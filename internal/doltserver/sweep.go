//
//   - its working directory sits under one of suiteRoots, or
//   - its working directory has been deleted AND the path it used to name
//     sits under one of tempRoots.
//
// suiteRoots MUST be directories owned by the calling test suite alone
// (e.g. that suite's own testTempRoot) — never a shared/global temp dir
// such as os.TempDir(). A live (non-deleted-cwd) server is only reaped when
// its data dir is nested under a root the caller vouches for as its own;
// otherwise a parallel test run (scripts/test.sh -p N) would see every
// *other* suite's still-live server as debris, since virtually all suites'
// data dirs live somewhere under os.TempDir() too. Passing a global root
// here would turn this safety net into a cross-suite server killer.
//
// tempRoots (see tempDirRoots) bounds the deleted-cwd arm to throwaway
// directories. A deleted working directory is a strong leak signal — a
// t.TempDir() cleanup ran on top of a still-live detached server — but it is
// NOT by itself proof of a TEST server: a production server is spawned with
// cmd.Dir = <workspace>/.beads/dolt, so a developer who moved or deleted that
// workspace, or whose external volume was unmounted, would have their live
// server reaped by any test run on the box. Requiring the deleted path to
// have been under a temp dir keeps the arm pointed at test debris only.
//
// This is intentionally conservative in the "never kill production" sense:
// a real shared server's data directory is a persistent, non-temp path, so it
// is neither under a suite's scoped roots nor — deleted or not — under a temp
// root, and matches neither condition.
