// package under scripts/test.sh -p N, or a second `go test` in another
// terminal), and the temp root of a run whose process is gone — killed by

// diagnosed and closed three times (wy-9byjk, wy-5ce39p, wy-j2zc8q) and every
// one of those fixes was landed alongside machinery that reported the leak on
// stderr and exited 0 — so each regression rode a green suite for weeks, and
// the leak was rediscovered from a dev box's process table rather than from
// CI. A reaped server means a test finished with a detached daemon still
// serving a directory the suite is about to delete; that is a defect in the
// suite, and the run should say so in the only channel anybody reads.
