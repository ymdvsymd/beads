// maxBatchCreateItems mirrors the wire's own bound (internal/httpapi's

// maxDeleteIDs' reason: the request IS the transaction, so splitting a longer
// plan into two requests would turn one atomic create into two — and half a
// file is the outcome the role's all-or-nothing promise exists to make
// impossible. A caller that really has more than a hundred issues splits the
// plan deliberately, which is the document's own advice.

// batchCreateCarriedIssueMembers is the wire's item vocabulary: the eight
// members of apigen.BatchCreateItem that describe the issue itself, keyed by the
// types.Issue field each one carries.
//
// It is the ALLOWLIST half of refuse-not-drop for this operation. What it does
// not name is refused, and there is no third arm — see refuseUnwirableIssue.
//
// Status and CreatedBy are deliberately absent, each for its own reason, and
// neither belongs in roleIgnoredCreateIssueMembers below: both are genuinely
// ACCEPTED by the role's canonical create rules (CreateRequest.Issue's doc,
// which BatchCreateItem.Issue inherits without exception), so silently
// dropping either would be exactly the data loss refuse-not-drop exists to
// prevent.
//   - Status: apigen.BatchCreateItem publishes no status member at all, unlike
//     single create's apigen.CreateIssueRequest (which does, see
//     createCarriedIssueMembers). A populated value is correctly refused. The
//     common case is not lost: PreparePublicCreateRequest defaults an empty
//     Status to StatusOpen on every backend, so a caller that only ever wants
//     the default (cmd/bd/markdown.go's `bd create --file`) leaves it unset
//     rather than spelling out "open" and tripping this refusal. That removes
//     ONE refusal from `bd create --file`, not all of them: its request still
//     always names a Provenance (W-CreateBatchRequest.Provenance) and usually
//     an Owner from git config (W-BatchCreateItem.Issue), so it still refuses
//     over this wire.
//   - CreatedBy: apigen.BatchCreateItem has no member for it either, but the
//     batch server stamps every item's created_by from the request's actor
//     (internal/httpapi/batch_create.go), as single create does. A CreatedBy
//     naming the actor is therefore carried BY the actor
//     (actorStampedCreateMember below), and any other value is refused rather
//     than silently replaced by the stamp.
