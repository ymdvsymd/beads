// Register adds the http client store to the backend registry under the "http"
// name, so workspace validation, discovery and store dispatch recognize
// metadata.json's `backend: "http"`.
//
// Deliberately not an init, for the reason postgres.Register documents:
// registration is a property of the distribution being built, not of the import
// graph. An OSS bd that reached this package transitively would gain a
// selectable "http" backend it must instead hard-fail on with
// UnknownBackendError. Only a distribution that opts in via its own
// build-tagged wiring in cmd/bd calls this.
//
// WorkspaceIsBeadsDir is true: there is no local database to discover, and
// metadata.json plus the activation sidecar are the whole workspace.
//
// Register panics on a duplicate registration, like any process-start wiring
// error, so it must have exactly one production call site.
