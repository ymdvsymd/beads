//
// This is the composition design D8's lane row specifies, and it is what a
// per-role contract binds against. The binding rule is the one composition_test
// states and checkFixtureBinding enforces: SEEDING NEVER GOES THROUGH THE
// CLIENT. Every fixture below takes its seed and post-state hooks from the
// reference store the server serves, and binds only the ROLE under test to the
// http client. A fixture that seeded through the client would prove that the
// client agrees with itself.
//
// Bare RunAll is deliberately absent. Its Factory contract wants a write-ready
// store and its cases seed through raw CreateIssue and SetConfig, both of which
// this backend refuses — so it would prove nothing about a partial backend
// except that it is partial.
//
// One environment per case. Standing up an embedded engine and an HTTP listener
// per case costs about a second; sharing one across cases would make an id
// collision between two contracts a debugging session instead of a rename, and
// the contracts namespace their ids by prefix precisely so they can be run this
// way.
