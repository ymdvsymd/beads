// IssueLifecycle left the partial column with client wave ga-jbuyf: createIssue
// was the operation its Create half had nothing to dial, and upstream #5483
// published it.
//
// The design page records seventeen because its row 17 was PENDING-DECISION when
// it was written. The decision recorded on ga-141ra moved BatchCloser across:
// `bd close` routes every id, single-id included, through CloseBatch, so leaving
// it refused left an http workspace with no close path at all while the server
// advertised issues.close to nobody.
//
// MetadataCAS and BatchApplier are the two the upstream sync added
// (compareAndSetMetadata #5473, applyBatch #5480), and they were the whole
// population of pendingWireBackedAccessors below, which is what that list was
// written for. MetadataCAS left it with client wave ga-7i6by.
// Counter and GraphCounter are the twenty-first and twenty-second, from client
// wave ga-icks1: countIssues (#5508) and dependencies.count (#5536) were both
// published by the wave-2 wire sync and both accessors landed with the same
// wave, so neither spent a PR in pendingWireBackedAccessors below.
//
// Releaser, Commenter and IssueRelations are the twenty-third, twenty-fourth
// and twenty-fifth, from client wave ga-f352s. All three had been published
// upstream ahead of this client — releaseIssue #5507, addComment #5594,
// listRelatedIssues #5540 — and all three landed in ONE wave, so none of them
// spent a PR in pendingWireBackedAccessors either. What they have in common is
// the shape of the port rather than the shape of the operation: each maps member
// for member, and what each one cost was a decision about the ANSWER — an
// anonymous post-state, a stored row that must not be discarded, and a
// single-anchor miss that is a 404 rather than a sentinel.
//
// ReadyLister is NOT in this list. S3 reconciliation (2026-10) removed it: bd-enterprise's issueops.ReadyLister/ReadyListRequest/
// ReadyListing have no OSS counterpart at all — there is no v0 route table
// entry and no role type to accept one — so there is nothing for an accessor
// to return. S13 schedules it; until then this is a twenty-fifth row neither
// here nor in refusingAccessors, because OSS's storage.DoltStorage does not
// define a ReadyLister method for the matrix to count either way.
// BatchGetter is the twenty-sixth, and the first accessor added to this
// matrix since client wave ga-f352s: S3 reconciliation's own rebase onto
// origin/main brought in upstream #7248's issueops.BatchGetter (the
// batchGetIssues operation, POST /v0/beads/issues:batchGet), which
// storage.DoltStorage now requires of every leg. Unlike every accessor
// before it, it was never a bare interface-completeness stub waiting on a
// client wave of its own — it arrived as a brand-new role on the SAME PR
// that wired it, so it spent no PR in pendingWireBackedAccessors below. See
// batchgetter.go.

// pendingWireBackedAccessors are the wire-backed rows of D8's matrix whose role

// refuses through (*Store).unsupported until its role bead lands. They are a

// that every OTHER wire-backed accessor already returns a live role while these
// still refuse — which is what forces a flip to move the name across in the same
// PR as the wiring.
//
// IT WAS EMPTY, and the case it was kept for arrived: "a v0 operation landing
// upstream tomorrow gets an accessor that refuses for exactly one PR, and this
// is the list that says so out loud." Two did — compareAndSetMetadata (#5473)
// and applyBatch (#5480) — and their accessors refused in accessors.go until
// the ports landed. MetadataCAS's did, with client wave ga-7i6by, and moving
// its name out of this list was not optional: the probe below fails the day a
// pending role starts answering, which is the flip rule enforced behaviorally.
//
// Leaving these OFF the matrix entirely was the alternative, and it is the one
// that hides them: an accessor named nowhere is an accessor no gate reads, so
// nothing would have failed on the day one was wired without review.
// IT IS EMPTY AGAIN, and that is the list working rather than the list being
// pointless: both names that entered it have left it through the flip rule the
// probe below enforces — MetadataCAS with client wave ga-7i6by, BatchApplier
// with ga-mijra — and the next operation the wire publishes ahead of its client
// wave lands here for exactly one PR.
