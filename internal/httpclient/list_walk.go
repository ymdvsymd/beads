// The listIssues pager: the three things the wire cannot carry for `bd list`,
// done here because the encoder table says they are done here.
//
//   - THE DISPLAY ORDER. The operation publishes `sort` now, so a BOUNDED
//     request in an order the caller named is one request: sortedPage names the
//     order on the wire and the server's own LIMIT decides which rows survive
//     it. What is left of ledger row L2 is the three legs that cannot take that
//     route — an unlimited read, a caller-supplied keyset position, and a
//     server that does not advertise the capability — which still walk to
//     exhaustion and then run the client-side comparator. The weld itself is
//     unchanged: a cursor is bound to the paged order it was minted in
//     (`created` or `priority`, upstream #5666), and the server refuses it under
//     any other `sort`, because resuming a keyset position inside a different
//     order skips and duplicates rows; the seven display orders and every
//     reversed order never carry one.
//   - THE CALLER-SUPPLIED KEYSET POSITION. issueops.Reader promises every
//     implementation honors AfterCreatedAt/AfterID, and the wire populates them
//     only from an opaque cursor the client must not mint. So the position is
//     honored by a SKIP-FORWARD WALK: page the created-order wire from the
//     start and discard the rows at or before the position (D8 row 1).
//   - THE MaxRows CAP. The wire publishes no max_rows, so the cap is enforced
//     during page accumulation and the exact sentinel `bd list` classifies into
//     exit 2 is synthesized here (D12).
//
// WHAT IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT is a `created_before` jump for the keyset walk.
// It would be the obvious optimization and it is unsafe: created_before is
// strictly exclusive while the keyset upper bound is inclusive, so a jump
// computed from an instant whose storage granularity the client cannot observe
// would silently drop the same-instant tail — the exact drop L3 and L12 exist
// to prevent, traded for a round trip.

// wireListSort is the order listIssues serves when no `sort` names another,
// spelled as the sort key ListRequest.SortBy takes for it. A request in this
// order and this direction is the one shape the walk can stop early on, and the
// one shape the pushdown leaves alone.
const wireListSort = "created"

// flaglessListSort is how the pager spells ListRequest's own empty SortBy — the
// order `bd list` shows when nobody names one — as a value the published enum
// carries.
//
// The two are the SAME clause and not merely similar ones: sqlbuild renders `""`
// and `"priority"` through one branch (internal/storage/sqlbuild/sort.go,
// `if sortBy == "" || sortBy == "priority"`), and sqlbuild.Less mirrors it the
// same way. What the server does differently under the named spelling is run the
// page epilogue's comparator over the clause's output, which is a stable sort by
// the same key — order-preserving on rows the same clause already ordered.
//
// It cannot be sent as `sort=` instead: an empty value is not in the published
// enum, so the server would refuse it, and refusing is the correct thing for the
// server to do — an empty enum member is a client that failed to decide.
const flaglessListSort = "priority"

// walkPageSize is how many rows one request asks for when the CLIENT owns the
// paging rather than the caller's own limit — an unlimited read, or any walk to
// exhaustion. It is a round trip's worth of rows, not a bound on the answer.
//
// It is a var and not a const for exactly one reason: the multi-page arm of the
// walk — the cursor echo, the accumulation across pages, the termination — is
// only reachable with more rows than this, and a test that seeded two hundred of
// them would be paying seconds to exercise three lines.
var walkPageSize = 200

// defaultListLimit is the shared list default a nil ListRequest.Limit means.
//
// It is redeclared rather than imported: internal/workapi is denied to this
// package by depguard (a client-side filter is one no server-side gate can
// observe), and the constant is needed here because a walk to exhaustion has to
// know what to trim to. TestDefaultListLimitMatchesTheSharedDefault pins it
// against workapi's own from a test file, where the rule does not apply.

	// THE PUSHDOWN LEG. Each conjunct names a leg that must stay a walk, and

	//
	//   limit > 0   — an unlimited read has to cross every row anyway, so
	//                 pushdown saves nothing, and sending `limit=0` down would
	//                 newly meet the server's unlimited-read refusal that the
	//                 fixed-size walk deliberately never reaches. (A negative
	//                 limit returned above; this is "not unlimited".)
	//   want == 0   — the created order the walk ALREADY stops early on. Under
	//                 it `want` is the caller's limit and under every other
	//                 order it is zero, so this is that same fact spelled once
	//                 rather than a second copy of the condition that can drift
	//                 from it. Sending `sort=created` would be accepted and
	//                 would buy nothing but a larger skew surface, so the one
	//                 request family that predates the parameter keeps sending
	//                 no parameter.
	//   keep == nil — no caller-supplied keyset position. keysetFilter returns
	//                 nil for exactly that, so asking IT rather than restating
	//                 its condition is what keeps the two from drifting. The
	//                 filter discards from what the walk FETCHED, and run
	//                 against a page some other order truncated it drops rows
	//                 whose replacements were never fetched — a wrong answer,
	//                 not a slow one.
	//   sort + cap  — a --max-rows cap over an order SQL cannot express. This
	//                 leg's whole cap story is that min(limit, MaxRows+1) IS
	//                 the local expression, and for a GO-SIDE sort it is not:
	//                 workapi.SQLLimit pushes 0 down rather than the limit,
	//                 because the ordering happens after the query, so locally
	//                 the window is MaxRows+1 REGARDLESS of the limit and the
	//                 cap fires on the overage even under a limit at or below
	//                 it. A request bounded by the limit cannot observe that
	//                 overage, so pushing one down would answer where both
	//                 local mode and the walk refuse. sqlbuild.IsGoSideSort is
	//                 asked rather than its member named, so a second Go-side
	//                 key added there cannot reopen this silently. Uncapped,
	//                 the question does not arise and these keys push down like
