// Package httpstore is the enterprise client for the v0 `bd serve` wire: a
// storage.DoltStorage registered under the name "http" whose issueops role
// accessors speak HTTP to a remote server and whose every other method refuses
// with a typed sentinel.
//
// This package is the store skeleton — the mechanically generated refusing
// base, the sentinel, the benign local stubs and the registration glue. It
// issues no wire calls: transport and encoding live in sibling packages, and
// each role accessor here refuses until its role bead wires it.
//
// See the in-repo divergence ledger, engdocs/design/http-divergence-ledger.md,
// for every place this client's behavior knowingly differs from local mode.

// handed — and the non-mutating opens (previews, cross-repo hydration, doctor)
// open here too. The embedded arm splits the two (OpenForReadOnlyCommand stays
// writable, OpenReadOnly refuses), but a registered backend gets only this hook,
// so refusing writes here would break `bd ready --claim` on this backend. What
// keeps strict --readonly and a preview from writing here is cmd/bd's own
// chokepoints (CheckReadonly, the preview RunEs), and
// openNonMutatingStoreFromConfig names this arm as the exception to its
// refuses-writes invariant. TestReadOnlyOpenServesTheClaimBdReadyMakes pins it.
//
// The two hooks stay distinct because backends.Register requires both and
// because a later read-intent handshake belongs here rather than in a caller.
// The follow-up that closes the exception is a third backends.Backend hook,
// OpenNonMutating, for openNonMutatingStoreFromConfig to call: a preview or a
// doctor read would then get a store that refuses writes, while the classified
