// The WRITE door's refuse-not-drop completeness guard — the counterpart of the
// encoder bijection the read door already has (encode/bijection_test.go).
//
// The read gate cannot cover this half and says so: its rows are query
// parameters, and it explicitly exempts "rows about the WRITE shapes" because
// "this package encodes no request bodies". That exemption left the write side
// with a promise and no check. D8's refuse-not-drop enumeration — "every
// role-request field the wire has no member for" — was a list somebody wrote
// down, so a member added to issueops tomorrow would be silently DROPPED by
// every write role in this package, which is the one failure class no
// server-side gate can observe: the server rejects only what it receives.
//
// The gate runs three ways, and each catches a different staleness:
//
//	source -> wire      every populatable field of every write shape either
//	                    names a member of the wire body that carries it, is
//	                    routed some other way, or has a divergence-ledger row
//	                    refusing it. There is no fourth arm.
//	wire -> source      every member the wire body publishes is driven by a
//	                    field. A member nobody drives is a write this client
//	                    cannot make and has not admitted to.
//	ledger -> source    every write-shape ledger row still names a field this
//	                    table treats as excluded. A row for a field that
//	                    started serving is a leftover that would make an audit
//	                    of "is this refusal real?" unanswerable.
//
// It lives in this package rather than beside the ledger because the ledger's
// package deliberately does not import apigen or the role bodies, and because
// the encoded patch document — which is not a struct at all — can only be
// driven from here.

// carriage says how one field of a role request reaches the server.
//
// Exactly one of member and routed is set. A field that is in neither state is
// not in this table at all, and that is the statement "the wire has no place for
// it" — which is what obliges a ledger row.

	// need this, because its item is a nested body with a shape row of its own;
	// a create has no nesting to hang one on.
	//
	// It is not a way to leave the population unchecked. Every name here must
