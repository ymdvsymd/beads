// The four dependency-graph read roles, served from their v0 operations
// (design D8 rows 7-10).
//
// Each one is a thin projection, and that is a property of the wire rather than
// of the code: every response component on this surface is a Go TYPE ALIAS of
// the canonical struct the role returns (internal/httpapi/pinning.go asserts it
// by ASSIGNMENT, which a structurally-identical twin could not satisfy). So
// there is no field mapping to get wrong here, and deliberately none written —
// a hand-rolled converter would be a second copy of a contract the server
// already pins.
//
// What IS this layer's work is the contract each role's doc comment states and
// the wire does not restate: never-nil collections, the caller's request left
// alone, and the defensive caps the wire publishes no parameter for.
//
// They dispatch GENERICALLY, through the store's one door. A read role differs
// from its neighbors only in the parameters the encoder produced and the
// envelope it decodes, so an operation-shaped transport method per role would
// be a dozen spellings of one round trip — see the WireClient doc for why the
// two halves of that seam are shaped differently.
