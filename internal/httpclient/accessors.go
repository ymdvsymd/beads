// The TWENTY-FIVE wire-backed role accessors of design D8's allowlist v1, as
// amended by the `bd close` decision that moved row 17 across, and by the
// five the client waves added after it — Counter and GraphCounter (wave 2a),
// Releaser, Commenter and IssueRelations (wave 2b). A count in prose beside a
// list in code is a count that goes stale, so read the list. They are
// off the generated refusing shell — that is what keeps them off the unsupported
// allowlist and out of RunUnsupportedContract — and hand-written here so a role
// bead flips one accessor in place, in the same PR as the method that serves it,
// without touching the generator's skip list.
//
// An accessor that has not been wired yet refuses through (*Store).unsupported,
// so it already carries the server context D7 renders, and the comment on each
// names the v0 operation that will answer it — a flip has nothing left to
// decide. A wired one returns its role bound to the store's transport; the
// implementations live one file per role, so concurrent role beads do not edit
// the same body.
//
// THREE accessors are still on the generated shell, and after client wave 2b
// they are all there for ONE reason: VersionReconciler, Bootstrapper and
// InitVerifier are PERMANENTLY UNSERVABLE — no wire operation and none coming.
//
// THE SECOND LIST IS EMPTY, and it is worth saying that it existed rather than
// deleting it silently. It held the names the wire had published ahead of this
// client — an operation complete on the server with no accessor in front of it —
// and every one of them has now left it by being WIRED: Counter (issues.count,
// #5508) and GraphCounter (dependencies.count, #5536) with client wave 2a
// (ga-icks1), then Releaser (issues.release, #5507), IssueRelations
// (issues.related, #5540) and Commenter (issues.addComment, #5594) with client
// wave 2b (ga-f352s). The next operation upstream publishes ahead of a client
// wave starts the list again, which is what it is for.
//
// "UNCONSUMED" AND "UNWIRED" ARE NOT THE SAME THING, and this comment used to
// spell them as one. A name leaves the second list when its ACCESSOR lands here;
// its entry in cmd/bd's httpUnconsumedCapabilities leaves only when a `bd`
// command reaches the role over http. Counter's went with wave 2a because
// `bd count` became served; GraphCounter's stayed, because no `bd` command
// reaches that role on ANY backend. Wave 2b splits the same way and TWO of its
// three went: Commenter's, because `bd comment` is served, and IssueRelations',
// because `bd dep list` reaches that role on every shape but the multi-anchor
// default — the command was already classified served and was failing LATE, so
// wiring the accessor turned a refusal into an answer rather than moving a row.
// Only Releaser's stayed, RESCOPED from "no accessor" to the front door it
// actually waits on.
//
// WorkspaceConfig used to be on neither list because it was PARTLY wired — its
// reads served and its two write verbs refusing — and it is now simply wired:
// #5596 published PUT and DELETE /v0/beads/config/{key} and client wave 2c
// (ga-jpywb) dials both. THE PARTIAL COLUMN IS EMPTY, for the first time since
// this file was written.
//
// READYLISTER IS NOT AN ACCESSOR HERE, and it is not a removal: this lift
// carried bd-enterprise's issueops.ReadyLister/ReadyListRequest/ReadyListing
// over from a fork where upstream had published them, and S3 reconciliation
// (2026-10) found OSS has published none of the three —
// there is no role type to implement and no accessor return type to name.
// `bd ready`'s listing is unaffected; it already runs on IssueReader. S13
// schedules the role once upstream publishes it.

// wire-backed accessor, and the one `bd count` routes through.
//
// Its request maps member for member: every one of CountRequest's twenty-three
// filters is a published parameter, so nothing here refuses and no ledger row
// names a member. What the operation does NOT publish is anything the ROLE does
// not have — a count's plane vocabulary is one `include_infra` where a

// Releaser serves releaseIssue (POST /v0/beads/issues/{id}:release) — the
// TWENTY-THIRD wire-backed accessor, and the claim's inverse.
//
// Its request maps member for member and nothing refuses on shape. What the port
// had to carry instead is a fact about the ANSWER: a release leaves an ANONYMOUS
// post-state — assignee cleared, status open, started_at gone — which is the same
// row whoever emptied it, so the role cannot report an idempotent no-op the way
// Claimer does and every shape that would not write is a REFUSAL. Those refusals
// are the whole value of this accessor to a caller, so they travel whole rather
// than being softened into a quiet false.
//
// ONE OF THEM IS FLATTENED BY THE WIRE and is ledgered: `not_releasable` covers
// both "holds no claim" and "status will not accept a release", with no member
// telling them apart, so this client answers the wider of the two
// (L-release-notclaimed). See releaser.go.

// Commenter serves addComment (POST /v0/beads/issues/{id}/comments) — the

// SUB-RESOURCE collection rather than the issue.
//
// Three request members, one of them the path, and one result member: the
// smallest total mapping on this surface. What is worth knowing is what the role
// declines rather than what it carries — there is no comment READ here, because
// a comment page is a paging question with a cursor of its own and the wire
// publishes no such operation. The thread is read through getIssue's
// `include_comments`. See commenter.go.

// issue in the PATH.
//
// It is the SINGLE-ANCHOR member of the graph family, which is what makes its
// miss a 404 rather than the per-anchor Missing sentinel EdgeReader and
// GraphCounter carry: one request names one id, so there is nowhere to put a
// per-anchor flag and no need for one. Both halves of the walk are two-plane and
// a wisp id is a legal anchor, all of it decided server-side.
//
// `bd dep list` IS ITS FRONT DOOR, which is easy to miss because that command
// reads as an EDGE command: the multi-anchor default shape takes the EdgeReader
// batch, and every other shape — the single anchor, and any --direction up —
// takes this role, one call per anchor. So this accessor was the difference
// between a command that was classified served and failed at dispatch, and one
// that answers. See relations.go.

// ReadyClaimer serves claimNext (POST /v0/beads/issues:claimNext).
//
// IT ADDS NO ORDINAL, and the absence is the point: every accessor before it in
// this file counts itself as the Nth wire-backed one because it CROSSED the
// matrix, moving off the refusing shell in the wave that wired it. This one did
// not cross — it has been in wireBackedAccessors since the first commit, served
// by a composition — so the matrix stays at twenty-five and calling this the
// twenty-sixth would be counting a row that never moved. What changed is what
// stands behind the accessor, which is what the rest of this leaf is about.
//
// "The wire has no claimNext" was true when this leaf was written and stopped
// being true with upstream #5510. What the operation buys is not a round trip:
// it is the one transaction the composition could never have — selection, the
// compare-and-set and the hydration together — which is what makes an ephemeral
// row claimable, a lease actually written, and the returned cardinalities a
// description of the state the claim produced rather than of a listing taken
// before it.
//
// IT NAMES NO ID BECAUSE IT NAMES NO ROW: the caller asks a question and the
// server picks the answer. The filter travels as the QUERY STRING GET
// /v0/beads/ready's own decode reads — one predicate, one spelling — and the
// actor is the whole body.
//
// THE COMPOSITION SURVIVES as the down-level leg, capability-gated the way
// BatchCloser's is, so `bd ready --claim` keeps working against a server older
// than the operation. L14 is now that leg's row and not the role's. See

// WHAT THE PORT COST was a decision about the ANSWER, like every write in wave
// 2b before it. The operation PERMITS writing a credential-bearing key and then
// WITHHOLDS the value from its own answer — one projection serves the write and
// the read, so a PUT's body is the body of the GET after it — which leaves a
// successful write whose `value` member is absent and a result type with no
// spelling for "withheld". The client answers with the value it SENT, which is
// the operation's own promise rather than a guess about what redaction hid: the
// stored value equals the value sent for every key this plane accepts, because
// the one key with a normalization step is the one key the role refuses.
