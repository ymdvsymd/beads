// maxDeleteIDs mirrors the wire's own bound (internal/httpapi's delete.go, and
// the document's maxItems). It is checked HERE as well as there for
// maxAddDependencyEdges' reason, which is sharper on this operation: the whole
// delete is ONE transaction with at most one history entry, so a client that
// split a long id list into two requests would turn one all-or-nothing erasure
// into two — and the dependents guard, which can only see the ids of the request
// in front of it, would refuse a pair the caller had deliberately listed
// together. Refusing names the bound; chunking would quietly change the
// semantics.

// httpDeleter serves issueops.Deleter from the deleteIssues custom method
// (design D8 row 13) — the capability behind `bd delete`.
//
// The REQUEST maps WHOLE, ExpectedVersion included: deleteIssues publishes the
// compare-and-delete precondition and this client sends it, absent staying
// absent so an unguarded delete stays unguarded.
//
// What else diverges is the REFUSAL VOCABULARY, in two places, and both are
// ledgered rather than papered over:
//
//   - an id naming no row arrives as issueops.ErrNotFound without the
//     *NotFoundError that names WHICH ids (L-delete-notfound);
//   - the unforced dependents guard arrives as issueops.ErrValidation rather
//     than *DependentsOutsideRequestError (L-delete-dependents).
//
// Both still FAIL the request and still delete nothing — the outcome is the
// contract's, only the classification is coarser — and both retire the day the
// wire grows a distinguishing code and the extension members to rebuild them
// from. `bd delete` still names the ids it could not resolve, because the
// server's own role does and the CLI is talking to the person who typed them.
