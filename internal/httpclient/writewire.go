// WriteWire is the transport surface the WRITE roles dispatch through: the six
// mutating v0 operations plus the two memory reads that belong to the same
// role, plus the ready listing the composed ClaimNext is built from.
//
// It is a separate interface from WireClient's own method rather than a
// widening of it because a role bead should be able to state exactly what
// transport it needs. WireClient embeds it, so a store still holds one
// transport and the compiler still proves a build linked one.
//
// Every method here takes and returns apigen types. That is not laziness about
// a domain type: apigen.Issue IS internal/types.Issue (a Go type alias pinned
// by the document), so there is no second wire struct to convert through, and
// minting one would be the field-by-field copy the pinning exists to prevent.
