// WireClient is the transport seam between this store and a remote bd serve.
//
// The store skeleton dispatches no operations: the wire-core bead owns
// transport and each role bead grows this interface as it wires its operation.
// ServerContext is here from the start because the store itself owns the
// handshake snapshot — the workspace-identity probe reads it (D4) and the
// refusal taxonomy renders it (D7) — and because D6 makes the fetch lazy, so a
// store can be constructed before one exists.
//
// THE TWO HALVES ARE SHAPED DIFFERENTLY, and the difference is the roles', not
// an inconsistency. The write roles declare OPERATION-SHAPED methods in an
// interface of their own (WriteWire, embedded below): each one is a distinct
// body, a distinct request document and a distinct set of typed conflicts to
// reconstruct, so a role bead states exactly the operations it needs. The read
// roles dispatch GENERICALLY — they differ only in the parameters the encoder
// produced and the envelope they decode — so what they need from a transport is
// not an operation but the two primitives every dispatch goes through, which is
// why Preflight and Do sit on this interface rather than in a ReadWire nobody
// would implement separately.
//
// They are two primitives rather than one on purpose: D6's two-speed policy has
// to be able to refuse a post-baseline operation BEFORE a request is built, and
// folding the handshake into the round trip would make that unexpressible. Both
// are satisfied verbatim by *wire.Client.
type WireClient interface {
	ServerContext(ctx context.Context) (*apigen.ContextResponse, error)

	// Preflight applies the capability policy for an operation: a baseline
	// operation returns immediately, every other one forces the handshake and
	// checks its token.
	Preflight(ctx context.Context, op string) error
	// Do issues one v0 request and decodes its 2xx body into out, which may be
	// nil for a response the caller does not read.
	Do(ctx context.Context, req wire.Request, out any) error

	// WriteWire is the write roles' half of the seam (writewire.go). A role
	// bead grows this interface by embedding its own, rather than by appending
	// methods here: the store still holds ONE transport and the compiler still
	// proves a build linked a complete one, but the operations a role needs are
	// declared beside the role that needs them.

}

// There is no StreamWire half of this seam. S3 reconciliation (gc
// native-program, 2026-10) removed it along with journal_watch.go: OSS
// publishes no journalops.Watcher for a WATCH role to implement, so there is
// no operation-shaped streaming method for a transport to grow. The paged
// journal read (journalops.Journal, journal.go) is unaffected — it dispatches
// through the same two generic primitives every other read role uses.

// WireDialer builds the transport for a resolved target.
type WireDialer func(ctx context.Context, target Target) (WireClient, error)

// dialer is the process-wide transport constructor. It is nil until the
// wire-core bead registers one, which is what lets this package ship the store,
// the refusal surface and the registration glue without depending on transport.
var dialer WireDialer

// RegisterWireDialer installs the transport constructor Open uses. Init-time
// wiring only, the same rule as backends.Register: it is not safe against
// concurrent Opens and there is exactly one production call site.
