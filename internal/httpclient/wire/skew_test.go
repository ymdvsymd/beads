// The version-skew matrix.
//
// Everything here is a DOCTORED server: a hand-built ContextResponse or a canned
// problem+json describing a bd serve that is older, newer, or subtly wrong in a
// way no real binary in the fixture cache is. That is the point. The released
// binaries in the cross-version smoke lane can only be the versions that were
// actually cut; this file is where the branch matrix lives, because a doctored
// context can be a server that never shipped and a released one cannot be a
// server that has not shipped YET.
//
// The split is the design's (test-lane map, the skew rows): the deterministic,
// in-process half runs at PR cadence here, and the released-binary composition
// half runs in cross-version-smoke.yml. Neither substitutes for the other —
// this half owns the branches, that half owns the reality check.
//
// Three skew directions are covered, and they fail in different ways:
//
//	newer CLI, older server   the client sends something the server never had.
//	                          A capability it does not advertise is D7 case 2,
//	                          caught BEFORE the dial; a parameter it does not
//	                          know is D7 case 3, caught in the 400 that comes
//	                          back.
//	older CLI, newer server   the server sends something the client never had.
//	                          Every one of these must be IGNORED — an unknown
//	                          response member, an unknown capability token, an
//	                          unknown problem code — because the wire's
//	                          additivity is the whole reason a client older than
//	                          its server keeps working.
//	wrong server entirely     the identity gates: api_version and project_id.

// firstSliceTokens is what a v0 server from the first slice advertises: the four
// gated operations of the six-operation first release (`bd-serve-v0.md`, "The
// surface"). health and getContext contribute no token.
