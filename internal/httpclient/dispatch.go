// that every other one forces the handshake and consults the advertised token.
// Putting the call here rather than at each role method is what makes "every
// dispatch site honors the two-speed policy" a property of the code rather than
// of a reviewer's memory: a role that wants to reach the server has no other
// route to it.
//
// It is also the one place that knows an operation's HTTP method, so the bounded
// 503 retry lives here: the wire layer bounds Retry-After and hands it back but
// never sleeps or resends, precisely because whether a 503 is safe to come back
// to is a question only the method answers, and only a GET's answer is yes.
