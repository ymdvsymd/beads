// The Reader contract, run through client → in-process bd serve → reference
// store (design D8 row 1).
//
// WHAT THIS WIRING PROVES that no unit test can: the request this client
// encoded is the request the SERVER's decoder rebuilt, the role behind it is
// the same shared body a local `bd list` runs, and the page that comes back
// survives the JSON round trip. The seed handles are the reference store's, so
// a filter this client dropped answers with rows no case seeded.
//
// WHAT IS PARKED, and it is one cause with many names: `ListRequest.IDFilter`
// is the scoping tool almost every List case reaches for, and listIssues
// publishes no id parameter (E-ListRequest.IDFilter). Refusing it is correct —
// dropping it would answer about the whole workspace — but a case that scopes
// itself with it cannot run over this wire at all. Each parked case names the
// field that refused, and the refusal ITSELF is asserted below in
// TestServedReaderRefusesTheFiltersTheWireCannotCarry, so the parking never
// stands in for an unpinned behaviour.

// readParkBead is the bead every READ-side park cites, and it is a different
// constant from the write side's parkBead because it is a different decision
// with a different retirement.
//
// The write parks retire when the wire grows the members it deliberately
// withholds, or never. These retire when the wire grows a way to SCOPE a
// listing by id — the upstream ask D8 row 1 records alongside the `sort`
// parameter — at which point almost all of them go at once. Folding the two
// into one constant would have said they move together, which they do not.
