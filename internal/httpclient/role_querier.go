// httpQuerier is issueops.Querier over queryIssues (design D8 row 5).
//
// The expression is not parsed here and must not be: parsing, the predicate
// decision and the scan bound all live inside the server's role, which is what
// stops this client from shipping the truncating window both front doors used
// to apply. Five parameters go out and a page comes back.
//
// It is post-baseline, so the dispatch pre-flights: an older server that does
// not route this path answers a bare 404 that is indistinguishable from an
// entity's not_found, and consulting the advertised `issues.query` token before
// dialing is the only way to tell "this server is too old" from "nothing
// matched".

// row nor visit any row once. Those are the caller's request being wrong, and a
// caller must not be told to upgrade a server over them. Only what is left —
// a plain positive Offset — is this backend's own inability, and the encoder
// refuses that one with *ErrUnsupported (E-QueryRequest.Offset).
