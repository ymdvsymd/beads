// The Lifecycle PERSISTENCE-SEAM contracts, run through client → in-process bd
// serve → reference store.
//
// This is the half of the Lifecycle role that the three accessor-reachable
// contract files next door deliberately do not hold: every case here ends on a
// COLUMN rather than on a returned row — the persisted `is_blocked` projection,
// `metadata IS NULL`, a committed `AS OF 'HEAD'` read, the plane a create
// routed to — and no read on any role hydrates those. The contract expresses
// that as a raw-SQL seam on its fixture, and this leg answers it the way it
// answers every other out-of-band probe: through the REFERENCE store the server
// is serving from, never through the client.
//
// WHAT THAT MAKES THE TIER WORTH HERE. The subject is one HTTP request. The
// client sends it, recomputes nothing, and every postcondition below is read
// out of the database afterwards — so a settlement the server did not make
// inside its own transaction, a plane it routed the wrong way, or a metadata
// document it wrote as SQL NULL shows up as a raw-row fact with no role read in
// between to launder it.
//
// UpdateRaw is bound to the REFERENCE store's own untyped funnel
// (env.reference.UpdateIssue), never to the client: storage.UpdateIssue is on
// the client's unsupported allowlist by design (D8: re-routing a raw front
// door would put a second spelling of the edit beside the role's), so there is
// no client funnel to bind. That is fine for every case actually registered in
// this file, because none of them takes the funnel AS ITS SUBJECT — they use it
// only to SEED a precondition an httpLifecycle.Create or the configured-status
// vocabulary cannot reach directly (an already-deferred row, a custom
// "name:category" status create does not parse). The three cases whose SUBJECT
// is the funnel itself (RunIssueOperationsUpdateRawMetadataTakesTheFunnelsValueShapes
// and its siblings) are never called here — asserting the reference store's
// funnel would be the mirror image of seeding through the client, and just as
// empty — so binding this hook carries no risk of laundering a client
// assertion through the store it happens to share a process with.
//
// ONE ENVIRONMENT PER CASE, which the contract requires rather than prefers:
// RunIssueOperationsCreateRoutesInfraTypesToWisps installs BARE workspace-global
// type vocabulary and leaves it installed, and the child-id cases mint against a
// counter a neighbouring case's seeds would move.
