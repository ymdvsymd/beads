	// HTTPClient replaces the transport. Tests use it to reach an httptest
	// server or to inject a round tripper; production leaves it nil.
	//
	// Leaving this nil is what lets DialWith apply a target's CA trust
	// (BEADS_HTTP_CA_FILE, or the sidecar's ca_file) automatically, and raise
	// MaxIdleConnsPerHost even when no CA is configured — see TransportFor and
	// baselineTransport.
	//
	// A caller that supplies an HTTPClient whose Transport is nil is not
	// silently skipped: DialWith injects the resolved CA transport (if any)
	// on a COPY of that client, leaving the caller's own *http.Client
	// untouched, exactly as if HTTPClient had been left nil except that the
	// other fields (Timeout, CheckRedirect, Jar) are the caller's.
	//
	// A caller that supplies an HTTPClient with a NON-NIL Transport has taken
	// the transport over completely. If the target has no CA configured, it
	// is used verbatim — DialWith has nothing to add. If the target DOES have
	// a CA configured, DialWith refuses rather than silently using a
	// transport that may not trust it: the caller must either leave
	// Transport nil (and let DialWith inject), or compose TransportFor(target)
	// (or TransportForFile, for the embedder door) into its own Transport
	// itself before calling.
	HTTPClient *http.Client

	// caOverride, when non-nil, replaces resolveCAFile's own env/sidecar
	// resolution entirely: DialWith uses *caOverride verbatim (which may
	// itself report "no CA configured" via its own configured() == false).
	//
	// It is set two ways, both of which need CAFileEnv taken completely out
	// of the loop rather than merely out-prioritized:
	//
	//   - DialOptionsForFile, which has already built HTTPClient's Transport
	//     from exactly one explicit file. Without this, DialWith's own
	//     env-scoped resolveCAFile would run anyway and could trip the
	//     caller-supplied-Transport refusal below the moment CAFileEnv
	//     happens to be set (and host-scoped-match) for the same target
	//     being verified.
	//   - DialOptionsForTarget, which backend/http's embedder door uses for
	//     EVERY dial: an embedder juggling several targets in one process
	//     must not have any of them silently renarrowed, or blocked, by an
	//     ambient CAFileEnv value a completely unrelated invocation
	//     exported — only Target.CAFile, passed explicitly, may ever apply
	//     on that door.
	//
	// Unexported: a caller outside this package can never set it directly, so
	// an external HTTPClient always goes through one of the two constructors
	// above, or the normal env-aware resolution.
