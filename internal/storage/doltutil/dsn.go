// maxAllowedPacketBytes is the client-side packet ceiling pinned into every
// server DSN. See the field comment in ServerDSN.String for why it must be set
// explicitly at all.
//
// The value is 1 GiB, deliberately NOT go-sql-driver/mysql's own 64 MiB
// default. It matches what the server we actually talk to reports: Dolt's SQL
// engine defines max_allowed_packet with Default 1073741824, and its type
// (NewSystemUintType("max_allowed_packet", 1024, 1073741824)) caps the sysvar
// at that same 1 GiB, so no Dolt server can report a larger value than this.
// Pinning the driver default instead would have lowered the client's ceiling
// from ~1 GiB to 64 MiB and made the driver reject oversized statements
// locally with ErrPktTooLarge — a real regression for large imports and base64
// content, which is why this is not simply mysql.NewConfig()'s value.
//
// Trade-off worth stating: the probe this replaces set the ceiling from the
// server's *configured* value, so an operator who lowers max_allowed_packet
// below 1 GiB no longer gets a client-side rejection. Nor does the server
// reject the statement instead: Dolt's engine does not enforce the sysvar for
// ordinary query packets (go-mysql-server reads it only in LOAD_FILE), so a
// lowered setting is no longer honored anywhere on the statement path.
