// Binding activation to these transactions could not mint a row, so it would
// be inert code that reads as coverage.
//
// The journal guard exempts a different set — the is_blocked recompute passes
// — which deliberately does NOT appear here: those recomputes never reach a

// TestEveryRawTxVersionScopeIsScopedOrExempt is the versioned-history twin of
// TestEveryRawTxJournalScopeIsScopedOrExempt, and exists for the same reason:
// the issueops guards (version_completeness_test.go) prove the mutation seam
// MINTS; nothing proved the store turns minting ON for the transaction the
// mutation runs in. That activation half was hand-enumerated here too — three
// sites against the journal's fifteen — and the journal's own comment records
// that hand-enumerating its half "was wrong both times".
//
// An unscoped versioned-history transaction is quieter than an unscoped
// journal: the mutation commits, and the version row is simply absent. Worse,
// absence is not inert. The next mutation that DOES run scoped mints
// MAX(revision)+1 = 1, so the history asserts that the update is the creation
// — a lie that reads as well-formed history.
//
// KNOWN LIMIT, inherited from the journal guard's shape: the scan is per
// FUNCTION, not per transaction. RemoveDependencyWithOptions begins two
// transactions in one body (wisp arm, non-wisp arm) and satisfies this guard
// once EITHER arm scopes — measured, by deleting each arm's scope in turn:
// only deleting both turns it red. That is the reason the fix scoped the
// inert wisp arm too rather than the issues-plane arm alone; a half-scoped
// two-arm function is a shape this guard cannot see.
