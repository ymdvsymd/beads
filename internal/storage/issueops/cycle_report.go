// The cycle REPORT: the shared body behind issueops.CycleDetector on all three
// backends, split into a pure half and a transactional half so the part that
// decides what the answer MEANS is testable without a database.
// CanonicalCyclePaths holds the determinism ruling, CanonicalMixedCyclePaths
// the IncludeTracks widening, and BuildCycles the honest-partial one; all
// three are pinned in cycle_report_test.go.

// CanonicalCyclePaths returns the cycles of a blocking graph as id paths, in a
// canonical form: each path rotated so its lowest id comes first, and the paths
// sorted against each other.
//
// EVERY SOURCE OF NONDETERMINISM IS REMOVED HERE, not just the order of the
// answer. A depth-first cycle enumeration records one cycle per BACK EDGE, and
// which edges are back edges depends on the walk: the roots came off a Go map
// and the adjacency lists came out of an unordered SQL read, so two runs against
// an unchanged database could disagree about which cycles exist at all.
//
// Duplicate neighbors are collapsed: a parallel edge adds nothing to
// reachability, and left in place it would make the same back edge report the
// same cycle twice.
//
// The result is NOT every simple cycle in the graph — see
// issueops.CycleReport.Cycles — but it is empty exactly when the graph is
// acyclic, and it is a function of the graph alone.

// CanonicalMixedCyclePaths reports the qualifying cycles of a graph that also
// carries `tracks` edges (MixedCycleEdge.Scheduling false). A cycle qualifies
// only when at least one of its edges is a scheduling edge.
//
// THE REPORT IS THE UNION, deduplicated by canonical rotation, of two sets:
//
//  1. CanonicalCyclePaths over the scheduling edges alone, which is exactly
//     the report the default request produces on the same data.
//  2. For every scheduling edge from -> to whose endpoints share a strongly
//     connected component of the mixed graph, the cycle that edge closes with
//     the shortest return path from `to` back to `from` over edges of either
//     kind (closeMixedCycle).
//
// Set 1 makes the widened report a SUPERSET of the default report. Set 2 alone
// would not: the default walk records the depth-first tree path behind each
// back edge, which need not be the shortest return path of any edge on it. And
// sampling one cycle per component instead would drop real deadlocks, because
// tracks edges can fuse separate blocks-only deadlocks into one component.
//
// Set 2 finds the cycles that need a tracks edge, the shape this exists for: a
// molecule root that blocks-depends (transitively) on its own entry step,
// which tracks-depends back to the root. Every internal edge of a strongly
// connected component lies on a cycle, so each such scheduling edge closes one,
// and a scheduling edge outside every component lies on no cycle at all.
//
// BOUND: at most one cycle per scheduling edge inside a component plus one per
// default-walk cycle, so never more than twice the distinct scheduling edges.
// That is the whole of the volume guarantee, and it counts EDGES, not
// deadlocks. A cycle made only of tracks edges is never reported, which rules
// out the pure-tracks shape AppendMixedCycleGraphInTx documents and nothing
// beyond it: one tracks-only loop fuses its whole neighborhood into a single
// component, after which every scheduling edge inside is on a cycle and is
// reported, however acyclic the scheduling edges are on their own. So the
// exclusion does not keep the report small on a tracks-dense graph — the edge
// count does, which is why this walk is opt-in and why `bd dep cycles`
// truncates its rendering.
//
// COST: one breadth-first search per distinct scheduling-edge target inside a
// component, confined to that component, and shared by every edge into that
// target. On a component of V nodes and E edges that is O(V(V+E)). A search per
// edge was O(E(V+E)), and on a dense tangle E grows with the square of V.
//
// Nodes, adjacency lists, components, and return paths are all ordered, so the
// answer depends only on the graph, not on Go map or SQL row order. The error
// is a broken internal invariant (see closeMixedCycle), never a property of
// the data.
