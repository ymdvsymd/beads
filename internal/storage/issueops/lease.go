// freshRowLock returns a random non-zero int64 for the row_lock cell.
//
// row_lock is the keystone of dead-worker recovery on Dolt. Dolt has no real
// row locking and merges concurrent commits cell-by-cell, so two transactions
// that touch DIFFERENT cells of the same issue row (a reclaim writing status,
// a close writing closed_at) merge silently instead of conflicting — which
// would let a reclaim quietly revert an issue the owner just closed. By having
// every status/ownership-mutating path rewrite this one shared cell to a fresh
// random value, those writers always collide on row_lock, surfacing the
// 1213/1205 serialization conflict that withRetryTx replays. The value's only
// job is to differ from whatever a concurrent writer wrote, so any source of
// entropy works; we use crypto/rand to avoid seeding concerns. Never 0 (the
// column default) so a freshly-claimed row is always distinguishable from a
// never-touched one.
//
// INVARIANT: any path that mutates status, assignee, or started_at on an
// in_progress issue MUST rewrite row_lock — that is the set the reclaim/close
// races care about (claim, close, updateIssueInTx, reclaim, unclaim all do).
// Paths that touch only orthogonal cells (is_blocked, compaction_level,
// dependency metadata, rename, or reopen — which acts on closed rows) are safe
// to merge with a reclaim and intentionally do NOT rewrite it. Heartbeats no
// longer touch the issues row at all (bd-lrgn1): the lease lives in the
// ephemeral leases table, where a racing heartbeat and reclaim contend on the
// SAME lease row and conflict without any help. Adding a new path that sets
// status/assignee outside updateIssueInTx without rewriting row_lock would
// silently reintroduce the zombie-merge bug.
//
// The exemptions are load-bearing in the OTHER direction too (analysis
// absorbed from gastownhall/beads#4682, Julian Knutsen): row_lock doubles as
// the RowVersion optimistic-concurrency token (types.Issue.RowVersion), so a
// path that reminted it WITHOUT changing the content a CAS holder cares about
// would spuriously fail honest ExpectedVersion checks. The is_blocked
// recompute is the canonical case: it is a denormalized aux-marker refresh
// that already goes out of its way to preserve updated_at
// (blocked_state.go), and bumping the token there would clobber a concurrent
// whole-row CAS over a cell derived from OTHER rows. (The PR's second
// exemption of this kind, the lease heartbeat, no longer arises here — since
// bd-lrgn1 heartbeats never touch the issues row at all.) So the invariant
// cuts both ways: status/ownership writes MUST remint, aux-marker writes MUST
// NOT. The remint direction is enforced at build time by
// TestAllIssueRowWritesStampRowLock (row_lock_guard_test.go), whose exemption
// markers are the machine-readable form of this list — widen the stamping
// policy there first, not by ad-hoc stamps.

// sql-server, where there is no sync interval to defend against — keeps
// exactly its old behavior. See config.NodeID for why there is no hostname
// fallback. The invariant the guard cannot enforce, and that every federated
// deployment still owes:
//
//	grace window > sync interval  (and TTL > sync interval)
//
// A TTL or grace shorter than the cadence at which replicas exchange state is
// meaningless across the bridge — the remote view is stale by a full interval
// by construction, so a reaper on the far side decides on liveness data older
