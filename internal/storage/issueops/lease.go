// freshRowLock returns a random non-zero int64 for the row_lock cell.
//
// row_lock is the keystone of dead-worker recovery on Dolt. Dolt has no real
// row locking and merges concurrent commits cell-by-cell, so two transactions
// that touch DIFFERENT cells of the same issue row (a reclaim writing status,
// a close writing closed_at) merge silently instead of conflicting — which
// would let a reclaim quietly revert an issue the owner just closed. By having
// every status/ownership-mutating path rewrite this one shared cell to a fresh
// random value, those writers always collide on row_lock, surfacing the
// 1213/1205 serialization conflict that withRetryTx replays. The value's only
// job is to differ from whatever a concurrent writer wrote, so any source of
// entropy works; we use crypto/rand to avoid seeding concerns. Never 0 (the
// column default) so a freshly-claimed row is always distinguishable from a
// never-touched one.
//
// INVARIANT: any path that mutates status, assignee, or started_at on an
// in_progress issue MUST rewrite row_lock — that is the set the reclaim/close
// races care about (claim, close, updateIssueInTx, reclaim, unclaim all do).
// Paths that touch only orthogonal cells (is_blocked, compaction_level,
// dependency metadata, rename, or reopen — which acts on closed rows) are safe
// to merge with a reclaim and intentionally do NOT rewrite it. Heartbeats no
// longer touch the issues row at all (bd-lrgn1): the lease lives in the
// ephemeral leases table, where a racing heartbeat and reclaim contend on the
// SAME lease row and conflict without any help. Adding a new path that sets
// status/assignee outside updateIssueInTx without rewriting row_lock would
// silently reintroduce the zombie-merge bug.
//
// The exemptions are load-bearing in the OTHER direction too (analysis
// absorbed from gastownhall/beads#4682, Julian Knutsen): row_lock doubles as
// the RowVersion optimistic-concurrency token (types.Issue.RowVersion), so a
// path that reminted it WITHOUT changing the content a CAS holder cares about
// would spuriously fail honest ExpectedVersion checks. The is_blocked
// recompute is the canonical case: it is a denormalized aux-marker refresh
// that already goes out of its way to preserve updated_at
// (blocked_state.go), and bumping the token there would clobber a concurrent
// whole-row CAS over a cell derived from OTHER rows. (The PR's second
// exemption of this kind, the lease heartbeat, no longer arises here — since
// bd-lrgn1 heartbeats never touch the issues row at all.) So the invariant
// cuts both ways: status/ownership writes MUST remint, aux-marker writes MUST
// NOT. The remint direction is enforced at build time by
// TestAllIssueRowWritesStampRowLock (row_lock_guard_test.go), whose exemption
// markers are the machine-readable form of this list — widen the stamping
// policy there first, not by ad-hoc stamps.

	// THE TRAP THIS INVARIANT COSTS (wy-sp2l4 F4), reviewed and KEPT. A

	//   (b) a foreign lease materialized by RestoreLeaseOnImportInTx whose

	//       labeled with the remote node.
	//
	// Re-homing on heartbeat would clear both — and the branch below already
	// says "heartbeat => this node grants it" (a heartbeat that matches no
	// lease row calls UpsertLeaseInTx, which stamps the local node). It is NOT
	// done on THIS path because the two are not the same claim: UpsertLeaseInTx
	// is MINTING a lease row through this store, while this UPDATE is refreshing

	// heartbeat arriving at this store — including one whose only path here is
	// the JSONL import that materialized case (b) — silently reassigns
	// enforcement of a lease another replica granted, which is precisely the
	// robbery the guard exists to prevent (a remote view is stale by up to one
	// sync interval). Keeping it makes the failure mode LOUD and recoverable
	// (reportForeignSkips summarizes it every run; --any-replica reverts it)
	// rather than silent. The escape hatches are documented in
	// `bd reclaim --help` and docs/multi-agent/federation.md; the fix for (a)
	// is to reap on the old name, or `bd reclaim --any-replica --id <id>` /
	// `bd unclaim --force <id>` for a single stranded unit once that replica is
	// gone for good.
	//
	// SCOPE, precisely: the no-re-home invariant holds on THIS fast path only.
	// The disambiguation fallback below re-homes, by design and unavoidably —
	// when `holder = ?` misses because the lease row spells the same identity
	// differently (ga-v2k49/ga-wzl83), it re-arms through UpsertLeaseInTx, whose
	// ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE stamps the LOCAL node over whatever was there.

// ReclaimExpiredLeasesInTx reverts in_progress issues whose lease has gone stale
// back to ready: the lease row is deleted, then status → open, assignee cleared,
// started_at cleared, and a fresh row_lock so the reclaim conflicts with a
// racing close/update on the same issues row (see freshRowLock). An issue is
// stale when its lease row's lease_expires_at is strictly before cutoff.
// Callers pass cutoff = now - graceWindow (the supervisor uses graceWindow =
// 2×TTL) so only leases that expired a safe margin ago — i.e. workers that are
// almost certainly dead — are reclaimed.
//
// Leases are node-local (the leases table is dolt_ignored and does not
// replicate), so a reclaim can only recover claims granted through this node —
// which is the only place the lease was ever enforceable anyway.
//
// REPLICA GUARD (wy-jpd3.7). "Through this node" is now enforced, not merely
// implied by the transport. The one path that can materialize a foreign lease
// row locally is RestoreLeaseOnImportInTx (lease fields round-trip the JSONL
// interchange), and a lease imported from another replica carries a liveness
// view that is stale by up to one sync interval — reverting on it can rob a
// worker that is very much alive over there. So a lease whose granted_node
// POSITIVELY names another replica is skipped, and only an explicit
// filter.AnyReplica (bd reclaim --any-replica) reverts it.
//
// The guard is OPT-IN and deliberately fail-open. An empty granted_node (a lease
// row predating ignored migration 0016, or the default state of any
// deployment that has not set config.NodeID()) is treated as local, so an
// upgrade can never strand a stale lease the reaper could previously recover,
// and a single-store deployment — including many hosts sharing one dolt
// sql-server, where there is no sync interval to defend against — keeps
// exactly its old behavior. See config.NodeID for why there is no hostname
// fallback. The invariant the guard cannot enforce, and that every federated
// deployment still owes:
//
//	grace window > sync interval  (and TTL > sync interval)
//
// A TTL or grace shorter than the cadence at which replicas exchange state is
// meaningless across the bridge — the remote view is stale by a full interval
// by construction, so a reaper on the far side decides on liveness data older
// than the lease it is judging. bd reclaim's default grace is 2× the lease
// TTL; raise the TTL (or the grace) above the sync interval, not the other way
// round.
//
// Reclaim only ever touches the permanent issues table: wisps are ephemeral and
// are never leased work. Returns the issues it reverted (id + the owner it took
// the lease from) so the caller can log/emit recovery events. The caller owns
// Dolt versioning.
//
// filter narrows which stale leases are eligible (see types.ReclaimFilter); the
// zero filter keeps the historical global behavior. Scoping is applied to the
// snapshot SELECT only — the per-row DELETE/UPDATE re-checks staleness by id,
// and the ids it re-checks all came from the already-scoped snapshot, so a
// label removed mid-reclaim cannot smuggle an out-of-scope issue into the
