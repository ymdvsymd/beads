// Dual-write issue-version history records every accepted issue mutation as a
// row in issue_versions, written in the SAME transaction as the mutation
// itself (see internal/storage/schema/migrations/0067_add_versioned_beads_schema.up.sql).
// Activation mirrors the durable events journal (journal.go): a per-instance
// flag (storage.VersionedHistoryConfigurer) is bound to a concrete
// transaction via ScopeVersionedHistoryTransaction immediately after
// BeginTx, so enabling history on one store instance cannot turn it on for
// any other sharing the process.
//
// RecordVersionInTx is the single seam both direct-SQL legs (dolt,
// embeddeddolt) and the domain/db package (used by uow) call through, from
// inside the same already-short-circuited functions that call
// RecordEventInTx — every accepted mutation of an issue's durable state
// (create, update, close, reopen, claim, release, lease reclaim, defer wake,
// label add/remove, dependency add/remove, promote, persistence move) mints
// exactly one row, as its LAST durable-state write; a no-op mints none. A
// mutation DiscardNoopIssueUpdates has already discarded never reaches either
// seam; the label and dependency helpers, which that filter does not cover,
// gate on their own inserted/deleted row instead (an idempotent re-add or an
// absent remove never reaches this seam either). Composite mutations —
// ExecuteUpdate's claim + row write + label/parent/persistence patches, and a
// batch create's rows + creation-time edges — run their constituents without
// minting and mint once at the end, so the version carries the final state.
// version_completeness_test.go pins the set of issueops functions that must
// reach this seam and the ones deliberately exempt from it.
//
// Ordinals are LOCAL, not wire addresses. issues.current_revision and
// issue_versions.revision are per-store ordinals, minted as MAX(revision)+1
// inside the writing transaction: two disconnected clones can both hold
// revision 8 for the same issue, each describing a different state. The
// only durable address of a version is version_id (migration 0068 steps
// 1-3, not yet landed). The HTTP API's RowVersion/Revision is a
// compare-and-set token, never an address; Phase 3's read surface returns
// version_id, never the ordinal.
//
// SINGLE WRITER ONLY until the version_id primary-key swap lands. With
// PRIMARY KEY (issue_id, revision), two disconnected writers that each mint
// the same ordinal for the same issue collide on merge, and
// TryAutoResolveMergeConflicts (internal/storage/versioncontrolops/mergesettle.go) fails the
// pull for a table it does not know. Enabling versioned history is therefore
// safe only with a SINGLE writer per store until migration 0068 steps 1-3
// (UUID version_id primary key, ordinal demoted to an index) land; those
// steps follow as their own PR.
//
// "Single writer" means one writer AT A TIME per store, not merely one
// clone. SELECT COALESCE(MAX(revision), 0) + 1 against PRIMARY KEY
// (issue_id, revision) is not a safe allocator for two concurrent
// transactions in one store either, and the label and dependency paths are
// not serialized on the issue row the way the claim/close CAS is; the
// RunDualWrite* contract cases exclude concurrent writers, so no test
// speaks to it. Tracked as gastownhall/beads#6379 (item 4).

// canonicalDurableState renders issue as the bytes RecordVersionInTx stores
// in issue_versions.durable_state: encoding/json's marshal of the issue,
// canonicalized per RFC 8785 (JCS). The canonical form is a function of the
// issue's content alone -- keys sorted, numbers in their one ES6 form
// (1.0 is 1, 1e300 is 1e+300), only the escapes RFC 8785 requires -- so the
// same issue state always yields the same bytes, whatever encoding/json's
// formatting happens to be. Numbers are canonicalized as IEEE-754 doubles
// (RFC 8785 section 3.2.2.3), so an integer past 2^53 is rounded here, once,
// by the writer, before anything hashes it: the stored bytes and the hashed
// bytes are the same bytes. types.Issue carries no such magnitudes (its
// integers are ordinals and priorities), but the rule is stated so nobody
// expects int64 fidelity from the token.
//
// Two properties worth stating because a hand-rolled canonicalizer would get
// them wrong. First, jcs.Transform normalizes away encoding/json's HTML
// escaping of <, > and &, so the token is a function of content, not of
// Go's escaping policy. Second, a snapshot that cannot be canonicalized
// deliberately FAILS the mutation: types.Issue.Metadata is a json.RawMessage
// passed through verbatim, RFC 8785 rejects duplicate keys, and this seam
// returns the error to its caller, which aborts the transaction. An issue
// whose metadata column already holds duplicate keys (reachable through bd
// sql or a hand-written JSONL import) therefore mutates fine with the flag
// off and becomes unmutatable with it on. Fail-closed is the policy for now
// -- bytes that could canonicalize two ways would not be a content token --
// and whether to normalize such metadata first, or to find such rows with
// bd doctor, is gastownhall/beads#6379 (item 3).

	// the one donnabox asked for on #6358 item 4: sha256(stored bytes) is a
	// stable content token, because the bytes read back are exactly the
	// bytes the writer produced. A Dolt JSON column could not provide that.
	// It parses and renormalizes what it stores (measured on dolt 2.2.3:
	// 1.0 reads back as 1, 9007199254740993 as 9007199254740992, 1e300 as
