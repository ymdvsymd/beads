// This file is the versioned-history twin of journal_completeness_test.go. The
// law it pins (gastownhall/beads#6358, Phase 2 dual-write): every ACCEPTED
// mutation of an issue's durable state — the issues/wisps columns, its labels
// and its outgoing dependencies, i.e. what GetIssueInTx hydrates plus what
// RecordVersionInTx loads — mints exactly one issue_versions row, in the same
// transaction, as the mutation's LAST durable-state write; a no-op mints none;
// a wisp is never versioned (the seam excludes it itself). Comments are not in
// durable_state, is_blocked is derived, and a deleted row has nothing to
// version, so those paths deliberately never reach the seam.
//
// Like the journal guard it detects mutators STRUCTURALLY, by the DML a
// function executes, so a new write path cannot ship without either reaching
// RecordVersionInTx or being justified in the exemption table below.

// versionMintHelpers are the helpers whose call mints a version row. There is
// exactly one seam; a function mints if it calls it directly or through a
// named helper (mintDependencyVersion, addLabelInTx, updateIssueInTx, ...)
// whose mint it did not switch off — see versionMintGate.

// (claimIssueInTx, updateIssueInTx, applyLabelPatch, applyParentPatch,
// moveIssuePersistenceInTx, addLabelInTx, removeLabelInTx, addDependencyInTx,

// — nothing in the derived-readiness family mints, and a mutator must not be
// able to inherit a mint through a recompute — with one refinement the journal
// guard has no need for: a helper that takes a mintVersion bool mints only
// when asked to, so a call passing the literal false for it is NOT a minting
// edge. That is how a composite mutation runs its constituents without minting
// and mints once itself at the end (ExecuteUpdate's claim, row write, label
// and parent patches and persistence move). Without the refinement the
// fixpoint credited the composite with the mint it told its constituents to
// skip, and deleting its own final RecordVersionInTx stayed green (reviewer
// Probe 2 on gastownhall/beads#6358). A call passing true, a variable, or the
