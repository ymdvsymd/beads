// three IncludeTracks cases cannot be satisfied over HTTP — the client fails
// loudly instead of wiring a narrower answer, which is why these three remain
// unwired rather than run-and-skipped.

// No shipped slice adds a query parameter, spec capability token, or
// handshake entry for this option — see "L-cycles-tracks" in the in-repo
// divergence ledger, engdocs/design/http-divergence-ledger.md, which records
// it as a refuse row rather than a wired one. Closing this gap is a new

// wiring the other half would assert a number that leg is right not to produce.

// This is the shape a lock like this has to be able to express. Every other

// create staged its own tables without sweeping the dirty row in. That needs a
// caller-held working set and a Commit hook to close it, and the unit-of-work
// provider has neither by design — every unit of work commits itself, with its
// own message, so there is no uncommitted state for a caller to leave lying
// around and no separate commit for one to be swept into. Its fixture supplies
// neither Commit nor Exec (see uow/role_fixture_kit_test.go), and the two cases
// dereference Commit unguarded rather than skipping loudly.
//
// Wiring them would mean inventing a commit boundary this backend does not
// have, to assert a property it cannot violate. That is a change to the
// backend's test surface, not a missing line, so it belongs in a change of its
// own rather than arriving behind a wiring lock.

// drives a reopen/reclose through it, RunIssueOperationsUpdateStampsStartedAtOnceOnTheFirstInProgress
// and RunIssueOperationsUpdateRawMetadataTakesTheFunnelsValueShapes assert
// what it writes). Wiring them against the reference store's funnel would
// assert a property of the store the server happens to share a process with,

// conformanceEntrypointsWiredBy reports the conformance entrypoints a leg's

//
// It counts every reference rather than only calls, because a leg is free to
// wire an entrypoint as a value: the unit-of-work leg drives five of its roles
// from a table whose rows hold `run: conformance.RunX` and call it later
// through the field. Counting calls alone read those ninety-one contracts as
// unwired.
//
// A file behind a build tag nothing sets is REFUSED: `//go:build ignore` over a
// file naming every entrypoint would otherwise satisfy this lock with source no
// build compiles. Ordinary constraints — cgo, integration — are counted,
// because a contract wired behind one is still wired.
//
// A REFERENCE IS NOT A PASS, and that gap is deliberate rather than a hole in
// this check. Several contracts (RetentionFixture, EpochFixture, BootstrapperFixture,
// VersionReconcilerFixture, ...) are written so a nil hook makes the case
// t.Skip loudly, naming the hook, rather than asserting nothing silently —
// see each fixture's own doc comment. That lets a leg wire the ENTRYPOINT
// (call conformance.RunX, satisfying this static check) while leaving some
// or all of its hooks nil, which runs for real as a skip, not a pass. This
// check cannot see past the call to know which hooks a wiring supplies, so
// it counts the reference as wired either way — a leg that did this would
// read as adopted here while its own `go test -v` output says SKIP. That
// divergence is this package's to prevent by review, the same way
// divergence_citation_gate_test.go (internal/httpclient) already holds the
// served tier's own skipKnownDivergence call sites to a named, ledger-cited
// reason instead of a bare t.Skip: a reviewer reading a wiring diff that adds
// a conformance.RunX reference should expect it to pass for real, or to carry
// a waiver in unwiredContractEntrypoints instead — not to compile a skip and
// call it adopted. As of this lock's current counts, no leg does this: every
// entrypoint a leg's sources name either has every hook that entrypoint's own
// cases need, or the gap is a named waiver here rather than a nil hook left
// standing behind a call this check would count as wired.
