// refusals — an unverifiable process record, a lock it could not acquire
// inside its 5s budget, a spawn still in flight — and every one of them left a
// live daemon behind a green run. Nine copies of the same silent handler also
// meant a tenth fixture could be written without one and nothing would notice.
