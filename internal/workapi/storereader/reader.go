// Package storereader holds the store-backed implementation of
// issueops.Reader: one shared body that every store-shaped backend's
// IssueReader accessor hands back.
//
// It is a package of its own rather than a file in internal/workapi for one
// reason. internal/workapi is the builders' home and 22 cmd/bd files import
// it, so a constructor living there was a one-line drop-in replacement for
// store.IssueReader() from any front door — and one that silently skips the
// telemetry decorator's reader-level spans, because a decorator adds its layer
// in its own accessor. Down here the only importers are the two Dolt store
// packages, and the cmd-bd-reader-constructor depguard rule in .golangci.yml
// makes a front door importing it a lint failure rather than a review comment.
//
// The accessor is the door. This is the thing behind it.

// New returns the issue-query surface backed by a store handle. *DoltStore and
// *EmbeddedDoltStore answer identically because the difference between them is
// below storage.DoltStorage, not above it.
//
// The reader supplies its own ConfigSource from the store it already holds, so
// a caller ON THE ROLE cannot half-perform the "load config, build filter,
// execute" ritual: it has no way to reach the pieces.
//
// THE BOUNDARY, stated once here because this is where the constructor lives:
// today the store-backed role answers `bd show --json` on the direct route,
// and the HTTP surface and the proxied `bd show --json` reach the uow-backed
// one. `bd ready` and `bd list` still call the workapi builders directly —
// they consume the FILTER for the max-rows cap, --claim, --watch, the
// hierarchical --parent tree and the text renderings — so Ready and List below
// are reached only by tests until a front door moves. They are covered by
// reader_test.go for exactly that reason, and their page epilogue is
// workapi.FinishPage, which `bd list` DOES run in every mode but the
// hierarchical --parent tree, so the untravelled path here is the query and
// not the tail. See issueops.Reader's doc comment for why routing only those
// commands' JSON paths through the role would be worse.
