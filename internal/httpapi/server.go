	//
	// A caller with a store takes them off the store's own accessors, and WHICH
	// store value it takes them off is the whole question. Every decorator a
	// store wears is on the value its accessor returns — that is what the

	// HookFiringStore -> InstrumentedStorage -> raw, so `store.IssueClaimer()`

	//
	//	src := store

	// cmd/bd's serveIssueRoles is that loop, written out.

	// Listen refuses a hook-firing role rather than trusting the paragraph
	// above — see checkDatabaseSource.
	//
	// WHAT LISTEN CANNOT CHECK, and the caller therefore owns: each call must
	// commit ON ITS OWN, atomically and durably. That is what this server's
	// contract states per request, and nothing here can observe the commit
	// protocol of the backend behind an interface — every check available would
	// be a self-declaration by the same caller-supplied code being checked.
	// Embedded Dolt is the backend that does not qualify (its commit runs
	// outside the SQL transaction on a separate connection) and it is refused
	// where the workspace is actually known: serveDatabaseSource in

	//
	// Unlike the provider path these are built ONCE, before Listen, rather than
	// per request. The provider path rebuilds its roles per request for exactly
