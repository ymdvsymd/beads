// This file holds the ONE rule by which an issue counts as GATED, and the
// projection of a gate onto the wire.
//
// GATED IS DERIVED, NEVER STORED. `bd gate create --blocks X` writes a gate
// issue plus an ordinary blocking dependency X -> gate; nothing on X changes.
// `bd ready` then drops X through the denormalized is_blocked column, and the
// rule here is the subset of that column's recompute
// (internal/storage/issueops/blocked_consistency.go) a gate can account for:
//
//   - the EDGE clause, from the recompute's first two union legs: the edge is
//     'blocks' or 'conditional-blocks' and the target is neither closed nor
//     pinned (IsGateEdge + the status test in GateIsHolding);
//   - the SUBJECT clause, from unmarkAllBlockedSQL, which forces is_blocked=0
//     for a closed or pinned subject whatever its edges say (SubjectCanBeGated).
//
// Both halves live here, in one predicate every surface asks, so a glyph, a
// header and a gated_by field cannot disagree with each other or with `bd
// ready` about the same bead.
//
// WAITS-FOR IS DELIBERATELY OUT. The recompute's waits-for leg does not apply
// the closed/pinned status test at all: it goes through waitsForGateBlockedSQL
// (internal/storage/issueops/blocked_state.go), which blocks only when the
// target has an OPEN parent-child child, or metadata.also_blocks names an open
// spawner. A plain `bd dep add X G -t waits-for` onto an open childless gate
// therefore leaves X in `bd ready`, and decorating it would be exactly the
// drift this file exists to prevent. Mirroring that leg in Go would be a
// second implementation of a rule the database already owns; a decoration that
// covers the fanout case is its own bead, not this one.

// GateRef is a gate projected for a caller: the id to resolve, what kind of
// wait it is, and why. It is what `gated_by` carries on the detail view.

// from this function or from the pair it is built out of, so a nonempty result
