// This file holds the vocabulary every one of the three new versioned-history
// contract files shares (Address, ChangeAttribution, Restriction,
// RetainedWindow, the PerRecordCASWrite hook shape, and the sentinel errors),
// plus the contract for R16/R17 (gastownhall/beads#6133, be-hs42e.1 §5-§7):
// the whole-of-state expectedRevision CAS write and its typed Refusal.
//
// THE SHARED VOCABULARY LIVES HERE, NOT IN A FOURTH FILE. All three contract
// files declare `package conformance`, so Go same-package visibility already
// gives cross-file access with no import; the architecture doc names exactly
// three contract files and does not say where their shared types live. This
// file's own §4a choice is to keep them beside R16/R17 rather than split out
// a vocabulary-only file with no tests of its own — R16/R17 is the first
// contract that needs them, so a reader asking "what is an Address" starts
// here.
//
// EVERY HOOK ON EVERY FIXTURE IN ALL THREE NEW FILES IS INDEPENDENTLY
// NILABLE — unlike metadata_cas_contract.go, where MetadataCAS itself is
// required and only two hooks are optional. Phase 0 ships zero real
// implementations of any of these capabilities in any backend's fixture kit
// (architecture §12: "every new hook is nil in every backend's fixture
// kit"), so every case below nil-checks every hook it uses and SKIPS BY NAME
// when one is missing — the same idiom history_matching.go uses for
// CountHistoryMatching.
//
// THIS SUITE DEFINES INTERFACES AND TESTS ONLY. Nothing introduced by this
// phase implements real CAS, invariant, retention, or epoch enforcement. The
// positive-path body of every Run function below is a complete, realistic
// assertion of what Phase 3's real hooks must do — because this suite IS the
// spec Phase 3 implements against (NFR-03) — but none of it runs today,
// since versioned_history_wiring_test.go wires every hook nil.
//
// RunExpectedRevisionCoversFieldsOutsideAnyWatchedSubset (R16-c) IS EXPECTED
// TO FAIL the moment a real backend wires CompareAndSetVersion, unless that
// backend has independently closed the row_lock partial-coverage gap the
// architecture doc's own §10 risk table names. That is deliberate — see the
// function's own doc comment — not a bug to relax the assertion around.
//
// DEFERRALS RECORDED HERE, NOT ACTED ON IN PHASE 0 (bee-ghosttrack's PR
// #6147 round-1 review; kept as ONE note so a later phase does not have to
// reconstruct these from PR comment history):
//
//  - UNRETAINED AND DISCLOSURE-GATING ARE A FUTURE AUTHORIZATION AXIS, NOT A
//    SIXTH Restriction VALUE. R11's bounded-window edge (an Address old
//    enough to have fallen outside a retention window, distinct from Gone)
//    and disclosure-gating (a store that presents a Gone or Unretained
//    Address as Unknown to a caller not authorized to learn it existed at
//    all) both layer an AUTHORIZATION dimension over the five states this
//    file already defines — WHO is asking, not WHAT the store knows. Adding
//    either as a sixth Restriction constant would conflate those two
//    dimensions; a later phase should model authorization as an orthogonal
//    axis instead.
//  - INVARIANT-DECLARATION DISCOVERABILITY: nothing in this suite lets a
//    caller enumerate which store invariants EnforceCrossRecordInvariant
//    knows about ahead of a refusal — InvariantRefusal.InvariantName is
//    only ever observed reactively. Deferred to whatever phase gives
//    invariants a first-class registry.
//  - LEASE TTL SELF-EXPIRY: LeaseHandle carries ExpiresAt
//    (cross_record_invariant_contract.go) but nothing in this suite
//    exercises a lease actually expiring on its own — only explicit
//    Release. Deferred until a real lease primitive exists to observe
//    timing against.
//  - R20-j's DURABILITY IS NOT PROVEN ACROSS A RESTART in this suite —
//    RunAStoreThatRemovesStateStillAnswersGoneDurably (retention_epoch_
//    contract.go) reads twice in the same process, which cannot
//    distinguish real durability from an in-memory cache that merely
//    outlives two calls. Deferred to the E2E tier, which can actually
//    restart a backend between reads.
//  - ERASURE'S GONE-RECORD TOKEN RETENTION (R5.1 machinery) is out of
//    scope here: RunErasureMintsACorrectedVersionRatherThanEditingInPlace
//    (retention_epoch_contract.go) checks that the original resolves
//    GoneErasure and the correction resolves Live, not what token or
//    tombstone content backs that GoneErasure answer. Deferred to the
//    later phase that specifies R5.1's erasure-record shape.
//
// THE "_attribution" PATCH-KEY CONVENTION (expectedRevisionAttributionPatch,
// this file) IS THE CANONICAL WAY TO THREAD A ChangeAttribution THROUGH A
// PerRecordCASWrite's generic patch parameter. Phase 3's hook documentation
// should point implementers at this convention explicitly, so no backend
// invents a second one.
