// This file holds the contract every implementation of publicops.Commenter
// must satisfy. Each case asserts what issueops/commenter.go PROMISES, cited
// by line, rather than what any one backend happens to do today; a backend
// that disagrees is parked at its own wiring site with skipKnownDivergence so
// the case still runs on the ones that agree.
//
// There are three wirings — the server-backed store, the embedded store and
// the unit-of-work provider — but only TWO bodies. dolt and embeddeddolt share
// storageissueops.ValidateAddCommentRequest and ExecuteAddComment and differ
// only in the transaction wrapper and the engine underneath, so the third
// wiring catches wrapper and engine divergence, not body divergence. A case
// passing on all three is two independent votes plus a wrapper check, not
// three.
//
// What is deliberately NOT here, and where it lives instead:
//   - the commit-message spelling ("bd: comment <id>"), which is a persistence
//     detail single-sourced in storageissueops.AddCommentCommitMessage and
//     pinned once, at dolt, in dolt/commenter_persistence_test.go;
//   - the dolt_status pending-row sweep, which needs a planted dirty working
//     set and has no caller-visible meaning on the unit-of-work route.

// CommenterFixture supplies adapter-specific storage access for the
// add-comment assertions. Every field is named and typed exactly like the
// per-backend roleFixtureKit hook it is filled from, so a wiring is kit plus
// accessor plus prefix with no adapter in between.

// not have is invisible to every thread read of the wisp.
//
