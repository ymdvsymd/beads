// This file holds the semantic contract every implementation of
// publicops.Deleter must satisfy. Each case asserts what issueops/deleter.go
// PROMISES, cited by line, rather than what any one backend happens to do; a
// backend that genuinely disagrees is parked at its own wiring site with
// skipKnownDivergence so the case still runs on the ones that agree.
//
// THERE ARE TWO BODIES BEHIND THE THREE WIRINGS. dolt and embeddeddolt share
// internal/storage/issueops.DeleteInTx and differ only in how they reach a
// transaction; the unit-of-work provider reaches the same questions through the
// domain use cases and is genuinely separate code. So the wirings are one vote
// plus an engine check, and a second independent vote.
//
// backend/conformance/audit_issue-lifecycle.go pins cascade, force, the orphan
// guard and the dry-run counts at the STORAGE SEAM, and cannot see the role at
// all. The cases below are the promises the ROLE adds on top of it: id
// normalization, the ordered refusals, the typed errors, the reference rewrite
// inside the transaction, and the history entry.
//
// EVERY CASE NAMESPACES ITS SEEDS with fixture.IssuePrefix and its own tag: the
// three wirings share one database across the whole role suite, and a delete
// can destroy another case's fixture.

// DeleterFixture supplies adapter-specific storage access for the named-row
// erasure assertions.
