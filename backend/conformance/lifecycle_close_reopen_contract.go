// This file holds the semantic contract for the two Lifecycle verbs that own
// the close/reopen transition — publicops.Lifecycle.Close and
// publicops.Lifecycle.Reopen — written against what issueops/issueops.go
// promises rather than against what any one implementation does. Create and
// Update live in issue_operations_contract.go; splitting the role across two
// files keeps two slices off one file, the way the staging contract already
// splits the persistence-level assertions out.
//
// Every case here runs on all three implementations. That matters more than
// usual for these two verbs: the server-backed and embedded stores share one
// validate/execute body (internal/storage/issueops/execution.go ExecuteClose
// and ExecuteReopen), so they are ONE vote on the semantics, while the
// unit-of-work backend reaches the same row bodies through domain/db and then
// derives Changed by comparing post-state instead of reading the row-write
// facts (internal/storage/uow/issue_operations.go:419, 458). Every Changed,
// OpenChildren, and refusal rule below is therefore a genuine two-implementation
// question, and the per-backend suites at dolt and embeddeddolt could never
// answer it.

// LifecycleCloseReopenFixture supplies adapter-specific storage access for the
// Close and Reopen assertions. Every field is named and typed exactly like the
// per-backend roleFixtureKit hook it is filled from, so a wiring is kit plus
// accessor plus prefix with no adapter in between.

	// CreateIssue seeds a durable issue in the issues plane, including its
