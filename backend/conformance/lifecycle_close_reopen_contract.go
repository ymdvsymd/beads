// This file holds the semantic contract for the two Lifecycle verbs that own
// the close/reopen transition — publicops.Lifecycle.Close and
// publicops.Lifecycle.Reopen — written against what issueops/issueops.go
// promises rather than against what any one implementation does. Create and
// Update live in issue_operations_contract.go; splitting the role across two
// files keeps two slices off one file, the way the staging contract already
// splits the persistence-level assertions out.
//
// Every case here runs on all three implementations. That matters more than
// usual for these two verbs: the server-backed and embedded stores share one
// validate/execute body (internal/storage/issueops/execution.go ExecuteClose
// and ExecuteReopen), so they are ONE vote on the semantics, while the
// unit-of-work backend reaches the same row bodies through domain/db and then
// derives Changed by comparing post-state instead of reading the row-write
// facts (internal/storage/uow/issue_operations.go:419, 458). Every Changed,
// OpenChildren, and refusal rule below is therefore a genuine two-implementation
// question, and the per-backend suites at dolt and embeddeddolt could never
// answer it.

// LifecycleCloseReopenFixture supplies adapter-specific storage access for the
// Close and Reopen assertions. Every field is named and typed exactly like the
// per-backend roleFixtureKit hook it is filled from, so a wiring is kit plus
// accessor plus prefix with no adapter in between.

// affected set unpinned — internal/storage/issueops/blocked_state.go's
// AffectedByStatusChangeInTx seeds the set with the id whose status changed,
// and deleting that seed leaves every one of those cases green. What it strands
// is not a transient: a blocked row that keeps is_blocked = 1 after it closes
// is an ORPHANED FLAG, because nothing downstream of a closed row will ever
// change its blockedness again and no verb will recompute it. The merge clause
// is the only place the invariant admits a stale column, and this is not a
// merge.
//
// THE CHILD IS THE OTHER HALF OF THE SAME SEED. The affected set expands by
// parent-child descendants FROM ITS SEEDS, and the depender load that reaches a
// neighbor follows blocks and conditional-blocks edges only — never
// parent-child. Drop the crossing row from the seed and its children go with
// it, silently, because no other case in this file hangs a child off the row
// being closed: the sibling's child hangs off the DEPENDER.
//
// WHY THE CLOSE IS FORCED. Both unforced refusals stand in the way here, and
// for opposite reasons — the subject is blocked (ErrCloseBlocked) and it has an
// open child (CloseOpenChildrenError). The child-shaped block that
// RunLifecycleCloseAdmitsATransitivelyBlockedTarget uses clears the first and
// not the second, and closing the child to clear the second would take the
// second subject with it, since a closed row cannot be blocked and so has
// nothing left to flip. Force waives close policy and nothing else —
// CloseRequest.Force "bypasses only blocker and open-child close policy" and
// "never bypasses validation, ExpectedVersion, or lifecycle rules"
// (issueops/issueops.go:310-311) — so it is the shape that keeps both subjects

// it) and it waits on the spawner rather than on the child (so the waiter load
// misses it too). Delete that one call and this case is the only thing that
// goes red. The DependencyEditor's gate case covers the ADD side of a gate; it
// runs through AffectedByDepChangeInTx and never touches this load.

// WHAT THE FIXTURE MAKES OBSERVABLE, and it is the whole design: the spawner
