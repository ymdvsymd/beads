// This file holds the contract for R20 (gastownhall/beads#6133, be-hs42e.1
// §5-§9): what a store reports about an Address once retention, erasure, or
// reorganization has stopped it resolving to live state (R20-a..R20-l), and
// the store-epoch generation counter that selectively voids addresses minted
// under an earlier one (R20-m/n).
//
// RESTRICTION AND RETAINEDWINDOW ARE DECLARED IN expected_revision_contract.go
// — see that file's package-level note on where this suite's shared
// vocabulary lives and why.
//
// GONE AND UNKNOWN ARE NEVER CONFLATED (FR-05, FR-06): Gone means the store
// once held this Version and no longer does; Unknown means the store has no
// lineage knowledge of the Address at all. Every RetentionAnswer names its
// PRODUCING STORE (R20-i) so a case can catch a backend that silently
// answers for the wrong store — this matters because R20 is explicitly a
// per-store promise, not a global one: a Reorganization can leave one store
// still serving an Address that another has moved past.
//
// THIS FILE ORIGINALLY MADE THREE §4a CHOICES THE ARCHITECTURE DOC DOES NOT
// PIN. Two have since DIED — retired by fixes made within this same PR,
// before merge, in response to review. Kept here, marked DIED, so a reader
// tracing why RetentionAnswer/RetentionFixture look the way they do does not
// have to reconstruct the history from git log or PR comments:
//
//  1. Remove/Commit's refusal under an active Hold is a typed error,
//     ErrRetentionHeld, rather than a non-accepted-shaped RetentionAnswer —
//     the doc names the promise ("must refuse ... unless forced", R20-h) but
//     not its shape. An error was chosen because Commit's success path
//     already returns a RetentionAnswer describing a Version that is now
//     GONE; reusing that same shape for a refusal would make "the hold
//     worked" and "the removal happened" look like the same kind of value.
//     (R17's Refusal reasons about the same tradeoff the other way, because
//     R17 already had a typed non-error outcome shape to reuse — Remove has
//     no such sibling shape to reuse here.) STILL STANDS.
//  2. DIED. ForceRemove's attribution used to be asserted only for shape,
//     not content, because RetentionAnswer carried no attribution field.
//     RetentionAnswer.Attribution now carries it, and
//     RunForcingAHeldRemovalRecordsWhoWhenWhy asserts real content — see
//     that function's own doc comment.
//  3. DIED. An address that no operation had touched used to resolve
//     RestrictionLive BY DEFAULT, purely by naming convention — a fabricated
//     Address, from the retired retentionAddress helper, that no store had
//     ever actually minted. Every case that needs a real, live Address now
//     mints one for real via RetentionFixture.Mint (see retentionMint).
//     RestrictionUnknown for a foreign store (FR-06) is UNCHANGED by this:
//     RunAStoreWithNoLineageKnowledgeAnswersUnknownNotGone and
//     RunGoneIsDistinguishableFromUnknown still test the Unknown case via a
//     second, foreign storeID that genuinely never saw the Address — not via
//     an untouched-but-fabricated address on the primary one, which is the
//     part that died. retentionAddress itself survives as the one helper
//     RunAStoreWithNoLineageKnowledgeAnswersUnknownNotGone still uses,
//     precisely because Unknown requires an Address no store ever minted.
//
// EVERY HOOK ON BOTH FIXTURES BELOW IS INDEPENDENTLY NILABLE — see the
// package-level note in expected_revision_contract.go. Every case
// nil-checks every hook it uses and SKIPS BY NAME when one is missing.

// RetentionAnswer is what a store reports when asked about an Address.
