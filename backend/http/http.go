// Package bdhttp is the public door to the http client store that ships
// inside this module (internal/httpclient) — the storage backend that speaks
// the v0 `bd serve` wire to a remote server — for embedders that link beads
// as a library rather than running cmd/bd.
//
// Such an embedder cannot reach the store any other way, for the reason its
// (hypothetical) postgres sibling would document: the registry facade's
// Register takes a backends.Backend value whose constructors live in an
// internal package, and the only other production wiring is cmd/bd's. Without
// this package a workspace whose .beads/metadata.json names "http" is a
// workspace an embedder can only tombstone.
//
// # Registration is two-step, and that is why Register takes Options
//
// Putting "http" in the registry is not enough to open anything: the store
// dials through a process-wide transport constructor that registration does
// not install on its own, so a binary that registered and stopped there would
// fail every open with httpclient.ErrNoTransport — a build-wiring fault, not a
// workspace or server problem. Register does both: it adds "http" to the
// registry AND installs the default dialer, and it installs a per-open
// OpenWith hook so a multi-tenant embedder (for example gc, Gas City — one
// process serving many workspaces, called "cities") can route a distinct
// credential through backends.OpenOptions / beads.OpenBestAvailableWith for
// each workspace it opens, without the process-wide dialer being asked to
// serve two tenants with one fixed credential.
//
// # Stability
//
// EXPERIMENTAL, on the same terms as the backend package this sits beside.
// Pin an exact beads version.
