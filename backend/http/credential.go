// workspaces, called "cities") that wants a distinct credential per workspace
// wraps that workspace's own provider in a ProvidedCredential rather than
// calling Open directly: the registered dialer Register installs is
// process-wide and cannot hold one credential per tenant, but the per-open
// OpenWith seam can, and this is the opaque wrapper type that seam
// recognizes. See httpclient.ResolveCredential and
// backends.OpenOptions.Credential's own doc comment for the single-tenant
// ambient-ladder default this exists to opt out of.
