# Type aliases for issue statuses, types, and dependencies
#
# IssueStatus, IssueType, and DependencyType are strings (not Literals) so the
# MCP layer doesn't have to be kept in lockstep with every dep type / status /
# issue type the bd CLI emits. The CLI is the source of truth and validates
# these values against the configured (or built-in) options.
#
# Custom statuses and types are configured via:
#   bd config set status.custom "in_review:active,qa_testing:wip,on_hold:frozen"
#   bd config set types.custom "agent,molecule,event"
#
# Custom statuses support optional category annotations (active, wip, done, frozen)
# that control behavior in bd ready and bd list. See docs/CLI_REFERENCE.md.
#
# Built-in statuses: open, in_progress, blocked, deferred, closed
# Built-in types: bug, feature, task, epic, chore, decision
# Built-in dependency types (see internal/types/types.go):
#   blocks, parent-child, conditional-blocks, waits-for, related,
#   discovered-from, replies-to, relates-to, duplicates, supersedes,
#   authored-by, assigned-to, approved-by, attests, tracks, until,
#   caused-by, validates, delegated-from
