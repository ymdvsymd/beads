"""Maintain `go_srcs` filegroups for tests that scan Go source under Bazel.

Some guards parse Go source at test time (journal completeness, role census,
import boundaries, contract-leg registry). Under `bazel test`, and above all
under remote execution, a test sees only its declared runfiles, so the source
it scans must be declared as `data`. Bazel globs stop at package boundaries,
so a scan over a directory tree needs one filegroup per package plus an
aggregate. Gazelle does not generate either; this script does, restricted to
the packages listed below, so only tests that need source pay for it.

For every package in PACKAGES, and every package under a root in TREES, the
BUILD.bazel file gets a managed block holding

    filegroup(name = "go_srcs", srcs = glob(["**/*.go"]))

(the package's own Go files plus those in non-package subdirectories). Each
TREES root also gets `tree_go_srcs`, aggregating every `go_srcs` under it.
Blocks in packages that are no longer listed are removed.

Run from the repository root after gazelle (see `make bazel-sync`). Output is
deterministic and gazelle-stable, so a clean sync leaves git clean.

Every package also gets a managed `repo_files` block: a filegroup of all of
the package's own files (`glob(["**"])` less local build and editor debris),
and the root package's aggregates every package's into `//:repo_files`. That
is the checkout as Bazel sees it, the `data` of the repository-policy tests
that walk the whole tree (every BUILD file, every test file, every tracked
Markdown file). A package without the block would drop out of their view and
pass them vacuously, which is why `make bazel-sync-check` (bazel.yml's BUILD
sync step, on every PR) fails on a missing or stale block. Trees in
.bazelignore (.beads, website, the nested example modules, agent worktrees,
node_modules) are outside Bazel and so outside //:repo_files.

tools/bazel/BUILD.bazel also gets a managed `release_cross` block: the
release_cross_build (tools/bazel/release_cross.bzl) that
scripts/ci/bazel-release-cross-compile.sh builds for every release platform,
listing every go_library and go_binary it can see (the packages `go build
./...` compiles; a private library is compiled by the go_binary that embeds
it) except the cgo-only ones a pure build cannot link (tagged "cgo-only" and
incompatible with //tools/bazel:pure), testonly fixtures, and the packages of
nested Go modules (tools/nogo), which `go build ./...` skips. The script checks
against `bazel query` before it builds that every Bazel package holding Go
targets is reached, so a package this parser misses fails CI instead of
going uncompiled.

With --check nothing is written: stale blocks are printed as a diff and the
exit status is 1 (see `make bazel-sync-check`).
