# `test --run_under=//tools/bazel:test_env`). It mirrors what
# scripts/ci/lib/test-env.sh does for `go test` in pr-core: a private HOME,
# XDG config, Dolt root and empty global gitconfig, so no test reads or writes
# the developer's or the worker's real configuration.
#
# Everything lives in one fresh mktemp directory under /tmp, unique per test
# process: HOME, config and TMPDIR must be short (t.TempDir() paths hold unix
# sockets, whose sun_path limit is 104 bytes, and Bazel's TEST_TMPDIR is deep
# under the output base) and must not be shared between concurrent runs of the
# same target. The directory is removed when the test exits. Only the fixed
# wrapper text enters the action key; no host path or client env does.
