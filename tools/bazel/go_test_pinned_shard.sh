#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Runs one Bazel shard of an existing go_test binary with the suite's slowest
# top-level tests pinned to shards of their own, so no shard's wall time is
# set by where the binary's round-robin split happens to drop its long tests.
# Like go_test_variant.sh it reuses the go_test's binary instead of compiling
# the package again.
#
# Usage: go_test_pinned_shard.sh <manifest> <binary> [binary args...]
#   <manifest>, <binary>: runfiles paths ($(rootpath ...)), relative to the
#     workspace runfiles directory, which is the test's working directory.
#   The remaining arguments (and any --test_arg) go to the binary unchanged,
#     after this wrapper's own -test.run/-test.skip.
#
# The manifest (tools/bazel/pin_shards.py writes it from measured test.xml
# durations) has one "<pinned shard> <TestName>" line per pinned test, pinned
# shards numbered 1..P with none empty; '#' starts a comment. With Bazel's
# shard_count N > P:
#   Bazel shards 0..P-1   run exactly their pinned tests (-test.run), with the
#                         binary's own sharding switched off;
#   Bazel shards P..N-1   are the binary's own round-robin shards 0..N-P-1 over
#                         every top-level test, minus every pinned one
#                         (-test.skip).
# So every test runs in exactly one shard: a pinned test only in its pinned
# shard, any other test (one added since the manifest was written included)
# where the binary's round-robin puts it. A manifest name with no test runs
# nothing (scripts/pinned_shards_test.go rejects one). Unsharded (no
# TEST_TOTAL_SHARDS, e.g. --test_sharding_strategy=disabled) the binary runs
# every test.
#
# rules_go sets GO_TEST_RUN_FROM_BAZEL=1 only for the go_test itself; this
# exports it, as go_test_variant.sh does, so the binary still changes into its
# package directory. The go_test's `env` is not inherited; the target repeats
# it.
