	// narrows a sweep, it does not assert that every named id was reclaimable.

// LeaseReclaimer sweeps stale leases back to ready — the capability behind
// `bd reclaim` — and, like every other capability here, a role with its own
// accessor.
//
// IT IS A DIFFERENT QUESTION FROM Releaser. Releaser gives up ONE claim a
// caller names, on the claim's own say-so (Actor, or Force). This sweeps
// MANY leases that have gone stale by a clock, on nobody's say-so but the
// clock's — a reaper calls this, not the agent that held the work. A surface
// carrying both would let a caller that may only report its own abandoned
// work reach into every other holder's, which is the same split Releaser's
// own doc draws against Claimer.
//
// WRITES, AND ITS HOOK IS on_update, once per reverted row. A reclaim clears
// assignee and status on each row it reverts, which is an update and is
// already how the journal classifies it — see Releaser's identical
// reasoning. There is no on_reclaim to fire and inventing one is not this
// role's job.
//
// Reclaim only ever touches the permanent issues table: wisps are ephemeral
// and are never leased work (see internal/storage/issueops.
// ReclaimExpiredLeasesInTx). The replica guard ReclaimFilter.AnyReplica
// documents is unchanged by this role — it is enforced in the shared body
// every library leg calls through.
//
// EVERY LEG RUNS ONE BODY: dolt, embedded dolt and the unit-of-work provider
// wrap internal/storage/issueops.ExecuteReclaimInTx, and the HTTP client leg
// dials POST /v0/beads/issues:reclaim (capability issues.reclaim), behind which
// bd serve runs the same body. `bd reclaim` runs this role on both of its
// routes. Each leg records one version-control entry per sweep that reverted
// anything, and honors a deferred version commit on the context.
//
// Deterministic request-validation failures match ErrValidation. Result
// values are unspecified when error is non-nil, and every refusal below
// leaves persistent state unchanged.

	// in Reclaimed, and is not an error.
	//
	// REFUSALS:
	//
	//   - an empty or all-blank Actor, or one longer than types.MaxFieldLen
	//     characters once trimmed: ErrValidation, before anything is read;
	//   - a negative OlderThan: ErrValidation;
	//   - more than MaxReclaimIDs entries in Filter.IDs, or an empty-string
	//     entry among them: *TooManyReclaimIDsError or ErrValidation,
	//     respectively, before anything is read;
	//   - an empty or all-blank entry in Filter.Assignees, Labels, LabelsAny or
	//     ExcludeLabels: ErrValidation, because it would match nothing a
	//     caller meant to name.
	//
	// Every ErrValidation refusal but the cap is a *ReclaimFieldError naming
	// its field.
	//
	// A sweep that finds no stale leases is not a refusal: it answers an empty,
	// non-nil Reclaimed.
