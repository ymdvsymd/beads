# BDP graph store — architecture and design

**Status:** Draft v17 (W-arch) — A1–A9 and decisions D1–D2 (plan rulings 13–14) ruled 2026-09-07; A10 ruled 2026-09-08; P0 current-wire completion open — feat/bead-graph
**Date:** 2026-09-12 (v16: 2026-09-10; v15: 2026-09-09; v14: 2026-09-02)
**Companion:** `BDP_BEAD_GRAPH_PLAN.md` (the plan and its rulings, 1–14) and
`BDP_GRAPH_CLI_AND_STORAGE_SPEC.md` (the detailed CLI and storage-interface
changes). This document is the *shape*: what the pieces are, where they live,
how a request flows, and where this design corrects the plan after the
tree's own conventions were read closely. Eight three-reviewer councils
(Claude, Codex, Gemini) reviewed v1–v9; §2 records what changed and which
changes amend a ruling rather than a mechanism. Rounds 3–5 converged on one
area — the authority mechanism — and every round since v3 has replaced an
invented primitive with one the tree already has. v6 added the
operator's **simplification ruling (A9)**; v9 states its arbiter honestly:
physical database copies are an operator-managed hazard, not a fenced one.

Revision v15: 2026-09-09 current-source alignment and council corrections;
phase/owner gates and pinned-source clarity added, historical rulings preserved.
Revision v16: 2026-09-10 formal-review correction carries the already-ruled A10
into §2b and refreshes current dependency status. It does not clear the
reviewer/owner merge gate.

Revision v17: 2026-09-12 records the P0 Read adoption and merged BDP
Transactional/History dependencies consistently with the owning plan; no new
contract pin, migration slot or runtime capability is selected.

## Current dependency alignment (2026-09-09, refreshed 2026-09-12)

[Plan §0a](BDP_BEAD_GRAPH_PLAN.md#0a-current-bdp-and-versioned-beads-alignment-2026-09-09)
contains the historical source records and the 2026-09-12 current refresh:
BDP #19/#20 and History #30 wire/spec are merged; Jim's Phase 1 is merged
and Phase 0/2 remain open. History realization and provider mapping remain
separate from the completed upstream normative materialization. The role split remains: graphops is the
graph domain, Jim's writer owns Issue history, and BDP wire DTOs own protocol
representations. No Issue projection or C-lane substrate change is selected.

The graph authority lease is not TX's receipt execution/creator-attempt fence;
the graph anti-reuse ledger is not the projected erasure ledger; an Issue
ordinal is neither a graph revision nor a durable History address. P3 must
compose its durable admission/effects/outcomes under the upstream profile
contract. A future History provider must translate context, numeric values,
retained identity and erasure provenance explicitly. These obligations do
not add Writer or History methods to the existing P0 interface sketch.
The P3 ADR audits storage/interface deltas and their migration, state-version,
fence, replication-inspection and census implications under plan §0a. The
initial eight-table P1 scope does not prescribe future tables or another
accessor widening; any necessary addition honors frozen migrations and A8's
source-break policy. P1 need not await the full P3 design.

P0 adopted the Read foundation at `19923f5bb6cc3f4ee4c508e36df3bd4c5c52344b`;
plan §0 records its exact pins and dated contract checks, including the narrow
erased-pointer port. The original pin and tests remain historical. Later
wire adoption and applicable successor checks remain explicit gates. [Plan §7's owner gates](BDP_BEAD_GRAPH_PLAN.md#current-wire-and-profile-adoption-gates-2026-09-09)
assign P0 contract/parity work and P2 serving proof, including shared response
negotiation and applicable conditionals. P3 separately records its reviewed
write-profile pin and evidence exit; RU need not await TX-only runtime.
This alignment does not claim that all upstream drafts have
merged or that graph/P0 implements their runtime behavior.

## 1. The one-paragraph version

The graph store is a new **plane** beside issues and memories: a public leaf
contract package (`graphops`) declaring the value types, the laws, and six
role interfaces, reached through **role accessors on `storage.Storage`**
(`BeadGraph*`, to keep clear of the issue-graph `GraphCounter()`) exactly as
`issueops` and `memoryops` are — declared explicitly by every decorator
(promotion is the failure mode the censuses catch), wrapped by telemetry,
recursed unwrapped by the hook layer — with one shared transaction-level
body under `internal/storage` taking a `DBTX`-shaped runner so that both
Dolt stores *and* the unit-of-work leg call the same code, proven by
`backend/conformance` role contracts wired on all three legs and guarded by
the existing coverage gates. BDP is served by the existing
`internal/httpapi` server as a **conditional second route table** behind the
same `route()` middleware — in v0 **only from SQL-server workspaces** (the
unit-of-work leg; `bd serve` refuses embedded Dolt permanently, and a
registered backend's store arm has no fence to offer until it declares
one). `bd --graph-mode link serve` is the strict command over that server: it mints and
it requires a Scope this workspace holds; `bd serve` mounts the same rows
when it holds an already-minted Scope and never refuses on account of the
graph. Every operation is **one role call, one transaction**, asserting a
**store-owned authority witness** — loaded by the accessor from a
clone-local file bound to this installation, checked against a hash-chained
ledger head and, on the shared-database leg, a lease row the mutation itself
must update. The store refuses a clone without local authority, a restore whose
head is absent from the witness, and a promotion elsewhere; no caller can
supply the witness. Copies carrying coherent local state are an operator-managed
hazard, including a solo store copy; the store cannot infer their provenance.
A shared database is fenced by that
lease. Under A9, a configured remote neither grants nor removes authority;
hazard R's publication mechanism is deferred to the write-profile ADR. A
shared database that minted locally remains authoritative with a remote.
The A10 exception is an embedded workspace with no remote and no server: it has local authority and
local link-mode verbs, but serves no HTTP. Its workspace gate satisfies the
solo lease; appearance of a shared database or remote makes it a client host
under the existing rotation and steal rules. A10 also preserves the replication
case: a solo store later pushed to a remote counts as minted locally and remains
authoritative until a foreign delta appears. The full A10 row governs both cases.

## 2. Corrections to the plan and ruled amendments (read this first)

Two kinds of change are recorded here and must not be confused. A
**mechanism correction** replaces something the plan's §4 *proposed* with
the house idiom that already solves the problem; the ruling it serves is
unchanged. A **ruling amendment** changes text the operator ratified in §9;
the amendments below are recorded outcomes, with their ruling dates. They
are no longer proposals; an implementation gate is not a pending ruling.

### 2a. Mechanism corrections (no ruling changes)

| Plan §4 mechanism | Replaced by | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GraphCapable` as a *separate optional interface*, resolved by targeted decorator peels (`graphsource` package) | **Role accessors on `storage.Storage`** — the house rule — under ruled A8 option A; option B was rejected | Every accessor lives on `Storage` (28 today); `DoltStorage` embeds it; both decorators embed the `DoltStorage` *interface*. A method added to `Storage` is therefore **promoted through the embedded interface**: every wrapper compiles unchanged — which is exactly why the reflection census in `role_accessor_decorator_test.go` (and its telemetry twin) exists: wrappers must **declare** each accessor, and the census catches the ones that silently promote. |
| A `ResolveGraphReadSource` policy that "re-applies telemetry" after peeling | Nothing — **the accessors carry the layers** | This is what accessors are *for* in this tree. |
| `backend/types.go` aliases for every `graphops` type | **No aliases.** `graphops` is a public root package, like `issueops` | The completeness guard demands aliases only for types under `internal/`. |
| `internal/graphapi` as a separate meaning-function package | **The laws live in `graphops`** | Import rule and cycle. |
| A `ReadSnapshot` handed from a resolver to a handler; a caller-supplied expectation (v2/v3) | **One role call, one transaction, asserting a store-owned witness** (A1) | A witness the *caller* supplies is forgeable from the replicated rows. |
| `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` on the Scope row to serialize the ledger (v4); a bare `next = next + 1` counter (v5–v6) | **A single-row counter whose every allocation writes a fresh random cell** (`next_seq = next_seq + 1, alloc_nonce = <random>`) — the journal's `bd_events_seq` shape, corrected | Dolt has no row locks (`FOR UPDATE` is a parse-only no-op) **and merges concurrent transactions cell by cell**: two sessions each doing `next = next + 1` from the same value both commit and the counter reads one increment (probed on 2.1.8). Only a same-cell-*different-value* write is a serialization failure (`1213`) that `withRetryTx`/`RunTxResult` replay; the random cell makes every allocation one. The events PK is the second guard, and it too converges silently on byte-identical rows — the nonce makes rows differ. The journal's own prose carries the misconception; its PK plus duplicate-key heal is what actually guards it. `next` is reserved in Dolt's parser. |
| `DOLT_RESET --hard` to undo a refused publication (v4–v5) | **`DOLT_RESET --soft <pre-op commit>`, then per graph table `DOLT_RESET('<table>')` (unstage) and `DOLT_CHECKOUT('<table>')`** when HEAD is still the operation commit; **`DOLT_REVERT <op commit>`** when HEAD has moved; the ignored lease restored on either path under the same-holder guard | A hard reset discards unrelated dirty work on a shared server; a bare checkout after a soft reset restores from the *staged* root and reverts nothing (probed), the unstage step makes it revert only the graph tables; a revert preserves later commits from other actors. |

### 2b. Ruling amendments A1–A10 and decisions D1–D2 (ruled 2026-09-07 and 2026-09-08)

| # | Ruling | Earlier drafts said | Ruled outcome (A1–A9: 2026-09-07; A10: 2026-09-08) | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A1 | **9** ("the snapshot lease" in the obligation list) | dropped silently (v1); caller-supplied expectation (v2–v3) | **RULED.** **The per-call transaction is the v0 lease and asserts a store-owned authority witness:** the accessor loads the witness from the clone-local file and the body checks it *inside the same transaction* — Scope row identity, the hash-chained ledger head (exact-prefix identity), the lease row (a protected read `SELECT`s it inside the read transaction and checks holder, epoch, **and `expires_at > NOW(6)`** — a holder/epoch match alone proves only that no takeover was visible in the snapshot, not that the lease is live; **reads never write the lease**: on the serving leg the watcher renews and a near-expiry read fails closed as `lost`; a CLI read whose lease names this workspace but has expired regrants **once, ephemerally, before opening a fresh read transaction** and retries; the read's context deadline is derived from the remaining lease interval and is below it; a mutation `UPDATE`s it and requires one affected row, with the holder's installation key, epoch, **and the `fence` cell value read in this transaction** in the predicate, and **sets `fence` to a fresh random value and `expires_at = NOW(6) + ttl`** — every lease write does, so any two concurrent lease writers are a same-cell-different-value conflict Dolt reports as `1213` (probed on both the versioned and the ephemeral commit paths); the loser is replayed with a fresh random fence and **re-evaluates its preconditions**: a still-authorized writer then succeeds serially, a superseded or stolen one matches zero rows and refuses. An expired lease that still names this workspace is **self-regranted** by the same write — promotion is needed only when the holder or the epoch differ), and the graph-state version (the ordered per-table hashes of the eight replicated graph tables). Public request types carry **no** authority fields. The cursor type is opaque from P1. | Rounds 1, 3, 4, 5. |
| A2 | **7b + 12** (listener; "`bd serve` creates the Scope on first serve") | a sibling server (v1); `bd serve` mints (v2–v4) | **RULED.** **BDP rows mount inside `internal/httpapi`** as a conditional second route table behind the same `route()`. **Of the serving commands, only `bd --graph-mode link serve` mints** (A10 separately permits local solo minting), through the **one staged startup sequence** in the spec's Part A (shared gate → temporary source reads the Scope row → close → release → only when there is no Scope row: exclusive gate → reopen, re-check, mint → close → release → shared gate → serving source → re-evaluate the identity table under it → serve; the tree forbids a shared→exclusive upgrade, and the conformance case asserts the shared gate is released before the exclusive acquisition). `bd --graph-mode link serve` inherits `errServeReadonly` and refuses without a held Scope; **`bd serve` converts every graph failure into "rows absent + notice"** and is byte-identical without a URL. **v0 serves BDP only from SQL-server workspaces** (the unit-of-work leg): embedded Dolt never serves, and a **registered backend's store arm** — which may itself be embedded — has no fence, so its rows are absent in v0; an out-of-tree backend cannot import an `internal/` capability, so the seam it would declare is the deferred ADR's to define (a public interface or an in-tree adapter), not `graphcap`'s. **Intra-Scope references are stored Scope-relative and rendered against the live Scope row, never as absolute URLs, so a remount rewrites nothing; a server started under a base URL that differs from the persisted Scope URL refuses — serving under a new base is a rotation, never a remount** (operator, 2026-09-07). | Rounds 2–5. |
| A3 | **12** / §4 lifecycle | verbs "reserved now"; then a link mode prefix | **RULED.** Graph behavior is selected by the root flag **`--graph-mode link`** (default `dependency`; `BD_GRAPH_MODE`; config `graph-mode`), never by a verb prefix. The mode names the graph by its edge kind: every verb creates, reads, or serves the selected graph or refuses; `bd link` creates the selected graph's edge; without the flag every verb is byte-identical to today. The root store policy keys on mode and command path and is authoritative at every leaf-name call site (paired Cobra-walk and source-scan tests). | `bd link`, `bd graph`, `bd restore`, `bd promote` exist; a verb prefix named the protocol, not the graph (operator). |
| A4 | §3 layering | values moved silently | **RULED.** **Record it:** values, laws, and roles in public `graphops`; accessors named `BeadGraph*`. | Package layout is public API. |
| A5 | **11** (ledger "restorable independently … its own migration") | dolt-ignored table (v2); project-id file (v3); hostname key (v4) | **RULED.** **(i) The clone-local half is `.beads/graph-authority.local.json`**, bound to an **installation key**: a random id created once, `O_EXCL`, mode 0600, re-read after creation, directory fsynced, in the user config directory the tree's `UserConfigYamlPath` resolver already chooses (`~/.config/bd`, native fallback) — plus the canonical `.beads` path; never the hostname. Written only by the witness manager under a bounded exclusive lock; **transitions are multi-phase** (`begun → local_committed → published → config_written → finalized`, recording a **durable operation id** — a hash-covered, indexed `op_id` column on every ledger event, and the commit message — the pre-operation HEAD and ledger head, the operation commit, the expected graph roots, the remote pre-head, the pre-operation lease row, and the config intent), recovered on the next load by **evidence, not by phase alone**: the ledger is checked for the operation id (a crash between the commit and the phase write leaves `begun` with the operation committed), then the remote is classified as {still at the pre-head, contains this operation, contains foreign work}, and recovery resumes publication, finalizes, or undoes accordingly; on a shared database with no remote a locally committed transition counts as published, **executes any outstanding `config_intent`**, records `config_written`, and only then finalizes. An **undo is itself phased** (`undo_started → versioned_undone → lease_restored`) and resumes from its recorded phase regardless of whether the operation still appears in the ledger; in-process renewal and graph mutation pause for its duration; the lease is restored **only on the reset path and only if it still names this workspace**. `Advance` is a **descendant-aware compare-and-advance** that holds the file lock while a **provider-supplied verifier** (ledger-prefix and commit-ancestry checks, run in the store) decides: a candidate already contained in the current witness is a successful no-op, newer fields are never replaced by older ones, and a fork is rejected — commits may complete in one order and advance in another; opaque hashes alone cannot decide this, so the manager never tries to. The manager ensures the ignore entries and refuses a git-tracked path; a tracked witness is an **error-class** doctor finding (`sensitiveFileNames`). **(ii) The ledger is an append-only, hash-chained event table** (`mint`, `install`, `update`, `promote`, `rotate`, `allocate`, `tombstone`, `refuse_url`) with a single-row counter; the witness records the head `{seq, hash}`. **No event exists before mint.** The ledger lane (`bd --graph-mode link ledger snapshot|apply`) restores **anti-reuse history, not graph content**: an applied `allocate` whose row is absent becomes a `reserved` allocation (never reusable; reads answer gone), the Scope lineage is replayed, and the counter is set to `last_seq + 1`; full recovery is a database restore *plus* the lane. **(iii)** providers declare `LedgerDurability`; `bd --graph-mode link restore` rotates unless continuity is shown. **Two epochs, distinct:** History's `store_epoch` singleton (versioned-beads Phase 1, migration 0067) fences restore and replacement on the issue plane; the graph's authority epoch fences promotion on the graph plane; a restore must be reasoned about for both. **Stated residuals:** a whole-directory or whole-installation copy carries the witness and is undetectable without an arbiter — so outside A10, an *authority-preserving* deployment must have one (a shared database under A9). **A10 amends that topology restriction:** an embedded workspace with no remote and no server has local authority under its workspace gate; the solo/client-host boundary and rotation/steal rules are stated in A10 below. The solo leg is single-copy by operator responsibility; a copied or restored solo store that cannot establish continuity requires a new Scope, rather than a claim that the gate detects a coherent copy. Physical copies remain the stated operator-managed hazard. | Rounds 2–5. |
| A6 | §4 lifecycle (metadata.json; `BD_BDP_TOKEN`; `BDP_SCOPE_URL`) | both files; env token | **RULED.** **`bdp.scope_url` is a project fact in tracked `config.yaml`** (yaml-only; `BDP_SCOPE_URL` read first, then `BD_BDP_SCOPE_URL`). A mint with `--scope-url` writes it as the transition's `config_written` phase. **Once this workspace holds a witness, `bd config set`/`set-many`/`unset` refuse the key** (one guard in the shared `rejectProtectedConfigKey` path; a DB-free file check) — the URL then changes only through `bd --graph-mode link promote --rotate-url` / `bd --graph-mode link restore`, which are refused while an overriding `BDP_SCOPE_URL` is exported. **`bdp.client`, `bdp.server`, `bdp.insecure_http` live in `config.local.yaml`** via `bd init --bdp-server` and `bd --graph-mode link client`. The three new `.beads/` files join the gitignore template, `requiredPatterns`, and `trackedRuntimePatterns`; only the witness joins `sensitiveFileNames` (error class). No env-carried token; no token key in config; `bdp.client` blocked from env. | Rounds 2–5. |
| A7 | **9** (promotion "explicit and epoch-rotating") — *new* | v5 partitioned by hazard but fenced a subset | **RULED.** **Fences compose by hazard; every replicated graph mutation is fenced inside its transaction and, on hazard R, published by one primitive.** *Hazard S — a shared database* (every SQL-server topology): the dolt-ignored **`graph_authority_lease`** row (the `leases`/`RunTxEphemeral` precedent) with the **fence cell** predicate in A1 — the holder is the **workspace (installation key)**, so the serving process and the workspace's own CLI verbs share it (`promote` and `rotate` take the *shared* gate and rely on the lease; `types install`, `restore`, and `ledger apply` take the exclusive gate and require the server stopped); renewal is ephemeral, rewrites the fence, and extends `expires_at`; an expired lease naming this workspace is self-regranted by the next write **regardless of expiry**; a lease naming another holder is taken **only with `--steal`** — its expiry alone never grants a takeover — and the epoch is CASed. **A lease row is not proof of "minted here"**: `dolt clone` omits the dolt-ignored table, but `DOLT_BACKUP` restore and a directory copy carry the working set with it, and Dolt's `@@server_uuid` is per machine (`~/.dolt/config_global.json`; probed identical for a same-machine copy), so no in-band identity distinguishes a copied database served by a second `sql-server`. The lease row is therefore bound to `scope_url` and `authority_id`, and in-place promotion has exactly two paths: **self-regrant** when the row names this workspace, and **`--steal`**, an operator assertion of "same database" in the class of force-push and `bd sql`; a foreign holder's *expiry alone* never grants a takeover. `Promote --rotate-url` is the bootstrap that creates a new lease row under a new URL (refusing the old one forever) — the path for a clone, a restore that cannot show continuity, and a copy. Residual, stated: a `--steal` on a copied database creates a second authority; a restored copy is caught first by the witness's ledger head (`ErrStateRewound`). Throughput model, stated: concurrent graph mutations in one workspace serialize pairwise on the fence cell, and a fenced transaction that spans a renewal loses whenever the renewal commits first, so **every fenced transaction that runs beside a possible renewer (the shared-gate context) carries a deadline below a third of the TTL** (cancelled and retried past it — the replay budget must allow more than one attempt), in-process renewal is serialized against the process's own mutations with jittered cadence, and **`types install` runs under the exclusive gate**, where the sole writer sets `expires_at` itself and runs unbounded. **The file lock is held continuously from `Begin` through `Finalize`/`Abandon`**, and recovery acquires it first, so a live transition is never mistaken for crash residue. *Hazard R — a configured remote* **[deferred under A9, ruled: input to the write-profile ADR, not normative for v0]**: **every** replicated graph mutation (`Mint`, `Promote`, `Rotate`, `Install`, `LedgerApply`, the P1 seeds, P3 writes) runs through **`PublishGraphMutation`** on the provider: `DOLT_FETCH`; require the remote-tracking HEAD to be an **ancestor** of local HEAD (`DOLT_MERGE_BASE`); record the remote's graph roots and ledger head; the fenced transaction; a **scoped** commit (`DOLT_ADD` of the graph tables, `DOLT_COMMIT -m` — never `-Am`; a new `RunTxScopedResult` on the UOW leg, whose `Commit` hardcodes `-Am` today); `DOLT_PUSH` classified by a **typed** lift of the tree's untyped `pushRacePattern` (it already matches all three race routes) — on a race, refetch and compare **both** the remote-tracking ref's **ledger head** (`SELECT seq, hash FROM graph_ledger_events AS OF '<ref>' ORDER BY seq DESC LIMIT 1` — `MAX(seq), hash` errors under `ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY`, probed) **and the eight graph tables' diff** between the recorded remote pre-head and the new remote head (`DOLT_DIFF_STAT`/`dolt_diff` restricted to those tables; `DOLT_HASHOF_TABLE` reads only the working set) against what was recorded before the transaction: any graph delta or ledger movement → fail closed and undo — **never the `(authority_id, epoch)` tuple alone**, which a same-witness twin (a VM image or shared home) or a same-authority fork shares; neither changed (issue-plane divergence only) → keep the commit, `ErrSyncRequired`; any other failure → keep the commit, mark `unpublished`, retry later. The classifier lifts the **whole** of `isPushRaceErr` — its diverged-history and ancestor-PK-mismatch exclusions included — behind a typed lower-layer error. The remote-tracking ref is `remotes/<remote>/<branch>`, built by one provider API from the configured sync remote and the active branch (the `verifyPullLanded` spelling); a missing ref is vacuously an ancestor (the push creates it); an empty remote ledger reads as no head. Undo = `DOLT_RESET --soft <pre-op>`, then per graph table `DOLT_RESET('<table>')` (unstage) and `DOLT_CHECKOUT('<table>')` — a bare checkout after a soft reset restores from the *staged* root and reverts nothing (probed) — when HEAD is still the operation commit, `DOLT_REVERT <op commit>` otherwise; then, **on either path**, a compensating ephemeral write restores the pre-operation **lease** row — predicated on the lease still naming this workspace at the operation's epoch and on the current fence, and writing a fresh fence (a revert restores the Scope epoch while the ignored lease keeps the new one, which would lock the workspace out of its own lease — probed); if another holder now legitimately holds the lease, it is left alone; the undo runs before any other graph mutation. **Reads on hazard R** require a remote observation no older than `bdp.authority_heartbeat` (a serving process fetches on a timer; a CLI read fetches when stale), **comparing the remote ledger head against the workspace's witness — reloaded on every check — not against a process-local expectation**, and recognizing a **pending local operation** (a publication that landed before the witness advanced, or a `local_committed` record) as this workspace's own, so a publication by the workspace's CLI is a re-arm, not a loss; they fail closed after the grace. Recovery on hazard R reuses the same ledger-plus-eight-table delta classifier as the push race: issue-plane-only movement is `ErrSyncRequired`, never an undo. The fence watcher is a state machine `held → renewing → lost`: on loss the BDP rows are disabled atomically (legacy surface untouched), `bd --graph-mode link serve` exits 3, and the watcher joins before provider shutdown. *Both hazards → both fences.* A clone that received the Scope row by `dolt clone` has no lease row and bootstraps only with `bd --graph-mode link promote --rotate-url`; a copy or restore that carries the row is the operator hazard stated above. Services on an ephemeral home pin `BEADS_INSTALLATION_ID_FILE` to persistent storage, or every restart is a `--steal`. A `promote --rotate-url` beside a live server changes the served URL and the host allowlist, which are fixed at startup, so the server exits 3 and is restarted. Force-push routes bypass the fence as operator acts. | Round 5 (Codex C2–C4, H5, H7, H10, H11; Gemini). |
| A8 | plan §1 constraint #1 and ruling 12 — *new* | v5's method-set reasoning was inverted | **RULED: option A.** **A:** constraint #1 scoped to *behavior* (byte-identical gate output). Adding six required methods to `Storage` breaks **direct implementers** (the compiler catches them; six `ErrUnsupported` stubs; the joint `ReadyClaimer`/`BatchCloser` CHANGELOG entry is the precedent) and is **silently promoted through every wrapper that embeds the interface** — which is why the censuses are mandatory, not optional. **B:** an optional `BeadGraphCapable` interface on the concrete store is **not** promoted through an interface-embedding wrapper at all, so every wrapper must implement it explicitly *and* every consumer needs a resolver/unwrap — the v1-plan `graphsource` shape. | Round 5 (Codex M14, Gemini). |
| A9 | **9** — simplification, **as amended by A10** | — | **RULED 2026-09-07; solo exception ruled 2026-09-08.** **Outside A10's solo topology, v0 authority requires a shared database.** Hazard R's publication primitive, remote-read freshness, and multi-phase publication recovery are **deferred to the write-profile ADR**; a remote-backed workspace is a **non-authority** for any Scope it did not mint on its own shared database (its `bd serve` shows rows absent; its CLI reads refuse); cross-database promotion is **`--rotate-url` only** (a new Scope, continuity via the ledger lane). The graph tables still replicate through push/pull like any other table; the validator refuses foreign deltas. What remains of A7 is hazard S alone — one arbiter, one lease, one counter. **Topology matrix, as amended by A10:** a shared database that **minted locally** is authoritative regardless of any configured remote; a shared database that received the Scope row by replication, restore, or copy without a valid local authority refuses (`ErrNotAuthority`; `--rotate-url` or `--steal` as above); outside A10's embedded solo exception, the embedded and registered-store client-host arms refuse authority-establishing and authority-dependent local operations (`Mint`/`Promote`/`Rotate`/`Install` and local graph reads answer `ErrNotAuthority: authority requires a shared database`; the embedded client-host leg uses `bdp.client: server`, while the solo leg supplies the full local read contract under A10; client-mode reads stay allowed everywhere); a configured remote neither grants nor removes authority, and **transition recovery takes the local-operation path on every shared database** (the remote classification exists only when hazard R is in force); two shared databases that both mint under one tracked `bdp.scope_url` are settled by the replication/merge ADR — until it lands, the earlier `mint` event (lineage) wins and the loser rotates; every hazard-R passage (publication primitive, remote-read freshness, publication recovery, `Remote` fixture cases) is excluded — but the default-branch rule for the ignored lease table (Part D.5) stays, because it is a property of dolt-ignored tables, not of hazard R; A5's "single-copy by operator responsibility" sentence is withdrawn under A9; A10 subsequently adds the solo exception, whose single-copy safety is again an operator responsibility. Physical database copies remain the stated operator-managed hazard. **Selected for v0**: the only serving topology already is the SQL-server workspace, and this removes the largest block of new mechanism from P1/P2. | Round 5 (Codex C1: "require an externally observable fence or weaken the guarantee"). |
| A10 | **9**, amends A9 | embedded authority refused under A9 | **RULED 2026-09-08: B — solo topology.** An embedded workspace with no configured remote and no server mints a local Scope, holds a witness and a lease satisfied by the workspace gate (one process holds the embedded store), and answers every link-mode verb locally. It serves nothing: `bd serve` still refuses embedded Dolt. It becomes a client host the moment a shared database or remote appears, under the rotation and steal rules. A solo store later pushed to a remote is "minted locally" for the replication ADR — authoritative until a foreign delta appears. The embedded leg wires the full read contract for solo topology and the refusal contract for client hosts. Options A (defer to P3) and C (require a local server) were rejected. | Plan §9 A10; operator ruling 2026-09-08, raised by Steph's adoption harness (sjarmak/mem). |

A10 mechanism work for P1: assign the local solo mint trigger without adding a
serving path, and map its exclusive workspace gate to the shared-leg lease
predicates and fence census. The witness, Scope identity, ledger-head and graph-
state checks still apply; the gate satisfies the solo lease, rather than
requiring an invented shared database. The exact lease-row representation and
expiry/self-regrant mapping must be recorded before implementing that leg. This
is implementation work under ruled A10, not a new CLI-name ruling.

Two decisions recorded here and ruled 2026-09-07 as plan rulings 13–14:

- **Enforcement boundary for out-of-role writes — RULED 2026-09-07 (plan
  ruling 13, "A+B").** `bd sql`, the proxied `RawSQLUseCase`, force-push,
  and a merge can change graph tables without allocation, authority,
  revision, or owned-Link coupling checks. Out of contract; the
  **state-change validator** rejects invalid or foreign-authority graph
  state (a delta on the ledger-covered tables must be explained by ledger
  events since the recorded head; bead and link bodies by row provenance);
  and the eight replicated tables carry session-gated `BEFORE
  INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE` triggers that refuse a row unless `@bd_graph_role`
  is set — every graphops mutation sets it inside its transaction and
  clears it before `COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK` (the clear is load-bearing: a
  pooled connection keeps the variable otherwise — probed). Probed on Dolt
  2.1.8: the triggers fire (errno 1644), replicate through `dolt_schemas`,
  are created by one multi-statement `Exec` of a migration file, and are
  silent on `DOLT_MERGE`/`DOLT_PULL` (the validator's and ruling 14's
  territory). A fence against accidents, not credentials; the two-SQL-user
  boundary is a C-lane task. Three P0 verification rows gate the fence
  (spec B4).
- **Replication/merge ADR as a P1 gate — RULED 2026-09-07 (plan ruling 14, option B: the gate plus a four-law charter).** The merge entry points are not
  four Go functions: `mergesettle.go` exports seven, `fastforward.go` and
  `automerge.go` more; `CALL DOLT_PULL` merges inside Dolt on every pull
  route; the UOW leg's `doltVersionControlSQLRepository` calls
  `DOLT_MERGE`/`DOLT_PULL`/`DOLT_PUSH` directly; embedded federation sync
  fetches and merges; the remote-migrate gate does a fast-forward
  `DOLT_MERGE`. The validator runs **on every observed graph-state-version
  change**: the witness
  records the graph-state version — `DOLT_HASHOF_TABLE('<name>')` for each
  of the eight replicated graph tables in a fixed order, hashed together
  (the function exists in Dolt 2.1.8 and takes one table argument; the
  lease is ephemeral and excluded) and the HEAD commit; a body that sees a
  different version returns `ErrStateChanged` *without* validating inside
  the held transaction; the accessor validates under **one singleflight
  coordinator per provider instance** in its own transaction (ancestry
  `DOLT_MERGE_BASE(recorded HEAD, HEAD)`; row provenance for foreign
  updates), advances the witness, and retries once. Descriptor caches are
  keyed by the descriptors table's hash. **The charter:** (1) every SQL
  pull route fetches, inspects the eight tables between HEAD and the
  remote-tracking ref, and refuses a foreign-authority or unexplained
  delta *before* merging — `DOLT_PULL` commits a clean merge immediately
  and `ROLLBACK` does not undo it (probed), so inspection is the only
  pre-merge refusal point; routes that cannot inspect first (the
  CLI-subprocess pull, a merge already landed, restore, force-push) fall to
  the validator, which reverts the eight tables to their state at the
  recorded HEAD in a new commit when that HEAD is an ancestor (the hazard-R
  undo shape; later commits preserved) and marks the witness `unverified`
  otherwise; (2) no graph-table conflict is auto-resolved and `--strategy`
  never touches a graph table — the pull is refused naming the table, the
  remedies are the link-mode verbs; (3) a foreign graph delta is refused
  whole, never merged cell by cell, and the later of two mints under one
  URL adopts the earlier by an explicit verb the ADR names; (4) a
  workspace without a witness takes the remote's graph state wholesale and
  refuses to mint until rotated or stolen. Federation unfiltered in v0.
  The ADR (`engdocs/BDP_GRAPH_REPLICATION_ADR.md`) is P1's first
  deliverable, council-reviewed; no graph migration merges before it.

What none of this changes: ruling 9's level — the authority is the graph
store as reached through the normalized storage abstraction, on any
provider; Dolt is the reference realization; the CLI verbs and the BDP
handler are both clients of that abstraction.

Dependency direction, enforced: `cmd/bd → graphops, storage accessors,
bdpclient`; `internal/httpapi → graphops, bdpwire`; `internal/storage/* →
graphops, authority`; `graphops → beadserrors, stdlib`. A new depguard rule
denies `internal/storage/graphops` to everything but the three legs and
`domain/db`.

## 4. Roles — how many, and why

The house test: a role is a **different question**, born whole with the
methods that are shapes of one question; and *can one caller be entitled
to the read and not the write?* — if yes, two roles. Six, each behind its
own `BeadGraph*` accessor. **Authority is never a parameter.** Transitions
produce the witness and carry their own preconditions instead of the head
check — named per method.

- **`graphops.Reader`** — one record by path (grouped, bounded
  `ownedLinks`), keyset pages under an opaque cursor, incident Links.
  Protected.
- **`graphops.DescriptorReader`** — the ordered catalog and a keyed lookup.
  Protected. Bounded.
- **`graphops.TypeInstaller`** — post-mint install/converge with `install`
  events; a fenced mutation, **published through the same primitive as
  every other replicated mutation** on hazard R. P1. Before mint there is
  no install: the built-in catalog is installed by `Mint`.
- **`graphops.IdentityReader`** — the Scope row, the witness's claim, and
  `LedgerDurability`. **Exempt** (it reports state).
- **`graphops.ScopeBootstrapper`** — `Mint`, once, under the exclusive gate
  through a temporary source (the spec's one staged-startup sequence: shared
  read → release → exclusive only when there is no Scope row → release →
  shared serve), fenced per hazard, multi-phase: precondition *no Scope row*; INSERT the singleton Scope row, seed
  the counter, append `mint`, install the built-in catalog with its
  `install` events — one transaction, one scoped commit, published on
  hazard R, `config.yaml` written when `--scope-url` supplied it; then the
  witness is finalized.
- **`graphops.Admin`** — `Promote` (precondition: Scope row CAS + the
  fence; produces the witness), `Rotate` (precondition: Scope-row lineage
  and the lease; `refuse_url(old)` + `rotate(new)` in one
  transaction; `config.yaml` in the `config_written` phase; refused while
  `BDP_SCOPE_URL` overrides), `LedgerSnapshot`, `LedgerApply` (recovery
  predicate; anti-reuse history only; regrants), `MarkUnverified`/
  `ClearUnverified`. Authorized by being the local administrative
  composition root — `Promote` and `Rotate` under the **shared** gate (they
  rely on the lease and run beside a live server), `Install`, `LedgerApply`,
  and `bd --graph-mode link restore` under the **exclusive** gate; `httpapi.GraphConfig`
  has no field for it.
- **`graphops.Writer`** (P3, not now).

## 5. A read, end to end

```

Statement budgets are per role method (spec B2). A write (P3): the body
asserts **mutatingly** (the lease `UPDATE` with one affected row), runs the
no-op gate, records attribution, versions the source on owned-Link
mutation, takes the next `seq`, appends the event, stamps provenance; the
accessor commits **scoped**, **publishes on hazard R**, and only then
advances the witness — DB first, file second.

## 6. Where the rulings land

| Ruling | Lands in |
| --- | --- |
| 1 charter | `engdocs/PROJECT_CHARTER.md` edit rides the first merged slice |
| 2 substrate S1 | replicated migrations (scope, history, descriptors, beads, links, ledger events + counter, allocations) + the lease's three parts (`doltIgnorePatterns`, main-series creation, ignored-series twin) + `ignoredSource.sentinelTables` gains the lease |
| 3 allocation ledger | `graph_allocations` (derived; `reserved` state after a ledger-lane apply); `graph_ledger_events`; `graph_ledger_seq` |
| 5 withdrawal | nothing projects Issues; structural |
| 7a Scope URL | `bdp.scope_url` in tracked `config.yaml` (`BDP_SCOPE_URL` first); singleton Scope row; no dev-mode derivation |
| 7b listener | BDP rows behind `httpapi.route()` (A2) |
| 8 changefeed | P3 |
| 9 authority | store-owned witness in every transaction (A1); fences by hazard (A7), hazard S under A9, and the solo workspace gate under A10; contract cases incl. clone, restore, copied witness, expired-lease mutation, nonce mismatch, graph delta under an unchanged tuple, revert when HEAD moved, each phase's recovery |
| 11 restore vs identity | hash-chained head in the witness; multi-phase transitions; ledger lane = anti-reuse history; `LedgerDurability`; rotation (A5) |
| 12 store/Scope/client | `bd init` migrations only; among serving commands only `bd --graph-mode link serve` mints (staged); A10 solo mint trigger is a P1 mechanism; `bd --graph-mode link client` (A6); A8 options; registered backends absent in v0 |
| 13 out-of-role DML | session-gated triggers in the five table files (spec B4); the validator's ledger accounting (B3); three P0 verification rows; the two-SQL-user boundary is C-lane |
| 14 replication/merge | `engdocs/BDP_GRAPH_REPLICATION_ADR.md` first in P1; fetch-inspect-merge on the SQL pull routes; validator revert on the rest; graph tables excluded from auto-resolve and `--strategy`; clones take remote state wholesale |
| 6 wisps | not served |

## 7. What is deliberately not designed here

- Cross-request cursor continuation (P2 ADR); no collection routes before it.
- The write profiles' wire (W1), `graphops.Writer`, per-token authorization
  classes, the push-on-commit latency budget, and the
  acknowledged-but-unwitnessed-write window (P3).
- The replication/merge ADR's mechanism (§2b; the charter is plan ruling 14) — P1's first deliverable, `engdocs/BDP_GRAPH_REPLICATION_ADR.md`; precedes the migrations.
- A DB-privilege (two-SQL-user) boundary for the graph tables (C-lane, ruling 13).
- The `GraphPublication` capability a registered backend would declare to
  serve BDP (deferred; v0 serves from SQL-server workspaces only).
- Whether `bd --graph-mode link serve` remains after W2 (default: yes — the serving minting path).
- Type generation from the bead-type inventory (W3) — it feeds the built-in
  catalog `Mint` installs.
