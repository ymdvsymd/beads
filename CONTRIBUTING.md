# Contributing to bd

Thank you for your interest in contributing to bd! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Go (see `go.mod` for the required version; currently 1.26+)
- Git
- A C compiler (CGO is required for the embedded Dolt database)
- (Optional) golangci-lint for local linting
- ICU headers are **not required** for building -- see [docs/ICU-POLICY.md](docs/ICU-POLICY.md)

### Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/gastownhall/beads
cd beads

# Build the project (uses gms_pure_go tag via Makefile)
make build

# Run tests (uses correct build tags automatically)
make test

# Build and install locally to ~/.local/bin
make install
```

## Project Structure

```

├── cmd/bd/              # CLI entry point and commands
├── internal/
│   ├── types/           # Core data types (Issue, Dependency, etc.)
│   └── storage/         # Storage interface and implementations

├── .golangci.yml        # Linter configuration
└── .github/workflows/   # CI/CD pipelines
```

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests (recommended — uses correct build tags)
make test

# Run tests with coverage
go test -tags gms_pure_go -v -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...
go tool cover -html=coverage.out

# Run specific package tests
go test -tags gms_pure_go ./internal/storage/dolt/ -v

# Run tests with race detection
go test -tags gms_pure_go -race ./...
```

## Code Style

We follow standard Go conventions:

- Use `gofmt` to format your code (runs automatically in most editors)
- Follow the [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go) guidelines
- Keep functions small and focused
- Write clear, descriptive variable names
- Add comments for exported functions and types

### Linting

We use golangci-lint for code quality checks:

```bash
# Install golangci-lint
brew install golangci-lint  # macOS
# or
go install github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/cmd/golangci-lint@latest

# Run linter
golangci-lint run ./...
```

**Note**: The linter currently reports ~100 warnings. These are documented false positives and idiomatic Go patterns (deferred cleanup, Cobra interface requirements, etc.). See [docs/LINTING.md](docs/LINTING.md) for details. When contributing, focus on avoiding *new* issues rather than the baseline warnings.

CI will automatically run linting on all pull requests.

## Making Changes

### Workflow

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/my-feature`)
3. Make your changes
4. Add tests for new functionality
5. Run tests and linter locally
6. Commit your changes with clear messages
7. Push to your fork
8. Open a pull request

### Commit Messages

Write clear, concise commit messages:

```
Add cycle detection for dependency graphs

- Implement recursive CTE-based cycle detection
- Add tests for simple and complex cycles
- Update documentation with examples
```

### Pull Request Hygiene

**One issue per PR, and one PR per issue.** No piggybacking or riders — each PR should address exactly one thing.

- Keep PRs focused on a single feature or fix
- Do not include unrelated changes, cleanup, or "while I'm here" improvements
- Do not include `.beads/` data (database, JSONL) in your PR
- Make sure there are no extra generated or garbage files in your diff
- Include tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed
- Ensure CI passes before requesting review
- Respond to review feedback promptly

### ZFC (Zero Framework Cognition)

If you are contributing code that involves AI decision-making or orchestration, understand and follow the [ZFC principles](https://steve-yegge.medium.com/zero-framework-cognition-a-way-to-build-resilient-ai-applications-56b090ed3e69). In short: keep the smarts in the AI models, keep the code as dumb orchestration. Do not add heuristics, keyword matching, ranking logic, or semantic analysis in application code — delegate cognitive decisions to AI.

## Testing Guidelines

### Test Strategy

We use a two-tier testing approach:

- **Fast tests** (unit tests): Run on every PR via CI with `-short` flag (~2s)
- **Slow tests** (integration tests): Run nightly with full git operations (~14s)

Slow tests use `testing.Short()` to skip when `-short` flag is present.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Fast tests (recommended for development - skips slow tests)
# Use this for rapid iteration during development
make test

# Full test suite (before committing - includes all tests)
# Run this before pushing to ensure nothing breaks
make test

# With race detection and coverage
CGO_ENABLED=1 go test -tags gms_pure_go -race -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...
```

**When to use `-short`:**
- During active development for fast feedback loops
- When making small changes that don't affect integration points
- When you want to quickly verify unit tests pass

**When to use full test suite:**
- Before committing and pushing changes
- After modifying git operations or multi-clone scenarios
- When preparing a pull request

### Writing Tests

- Write table-driven tests when testing multiple scenarios
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Clean up resources (database files, etc.) in test teardown
- Use `t.Run()` for subtests to organize related test cases
- Mark slow tests with `if testing.Short() { t.Skip("slow test") }`

### CGO vs Non-CGO Tests

Tests are split into two categories based on whether they need the embedded Dolt database (which requires CGO):

- **Non-CGO tests** (no build tag): Unit tests for CLI parsing, helpers, and pure logic. These run everywhere.
- **CGO tests** (`//go:build cgo`): Integration tests that create a real Dolt database. Files often use the `_embedded_test.go` suffix.

```bash
# Fast non-CGO tests (recommended for development)
make test                     # or: ./scripts/test.sh

# Opt-in ICU regex path (maintainer-only)
make test-icu-path            # or: ./scripts/test-icu-path.sh ./...

# Run a specific package or test with shipped config
CGO_ENABLED=1 go test -tags gms_pure_go ./cmd/bd/...
CGO_ENABLED=1 go test -tags gms_pure_go -run '^TestMyFeature$' ./cmd/bd/...
```

On macOS, use the Make target or script for the opt-in ICU regex path -- they configure the required ICU linker flags automatically.

### ICU and Build Tags

All production builds use `-tags gms_pure_go` to avoid ICU runtime dependencies.
**Do not add ICU linker flags to the Makefile or `.buildflags`.**
See [docs/ICU-POLICY.md](docs/ICU-POLICY.md) for the full policy and rationale.

### Test Isolation with `t.TempDir()`

Database tests use `t.TempDir()` for isolation so each test gets a clean environment and nothing touches the production database:

```go
func TestMyFeature(t *testing.T) {
    tmpDir := t.TempDir()
    dbPath := filepath.Join(tmpDir, "test.db")
    store := newTestStoreWithPrefix(t, dbPath, "bd")

    ctx := context.Background()
    issue := &types.Issue{
        ID:     "bd-1",
        Title:  "Test issue",
        Status: types.StatusOpen,
    }
    if err := store.CreateIssue(ctx, issue, "test"); err != nil {
        t.Fatalf("CreateIssue failed: %v", err)
    }
    // ... assertions ...
}
```

Test helpers in `cmd/bd/test_helpers_test.go` provide database setup functions like `newTestStore`, `newTestStoreWithPrefix`, and `newTestStoreSharedBranch` (which uses branch-per-test isolation to avoid expensive CREATE/DROP DATABASE overhead).

### Table-Driven Test Example

```go
func TestIssueValidation(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name    string
        issue   *types.Issue
        wantErr bool
    }{
        {
            name:    "valid issue",
            issue:   &types.Issue{Title: "Test", Status: types.StatusOpen, Priority: 2},
            wantErr: false,
        },
        {
            name:    "missing title",
            issue:   &types.Issue{Status: types.StatusOpen, Priority: 2},
            wantErr: true,
        },
    }

    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            err := tt.issue.Validate()
            if (err != nil) != tt.wantErr {
                t.Errorf("Validate() error = %v, wantErr %v", err, tt.wantErr)
            }
        })
    }
}
```

## Your PR Will Not Be Overwritten

This project uses AI agents for maintenance. We've established strict rules to protect contributor work:

- **Your PR has priority.** If you've submitted a PR, agents must review and build on your work — not rewrite it from scratch.
- **Your tests matter.** Agents must preserve contributor tests unless they're actually wrong.
- **You'll get attribution.** Your commits and `Co-authored-by:` will be preserved.
- **No silent closes.** Your PR will never be auto-closed by a parallel rewrite. If changes are needed, they'll be discussed on your PR.

If any of this goes wrong, please open an issue — we take contributor experience seriously.

### Refactoring Campaign PR Intake Checklist

Before starting a rewrite, cleanup, or large refactoring pass, maintainers and agents must review open contributor PRs that touch the same area. Use this checklist to decide whether to merge, rebase, incorporate, or close each PR.

1. Identify overlap:
   - Read the PR description, changed files, linked issues, and latest review comments.
   - Compare the PR scope with the planned refactor and note any shared files, commands, migrations, tests, docs, or release paths.
   - If the PR is unrelated, leave it alone unless the refactor would still create a merge conflict.

2. Prefer clean merges:
   - If the PR is focused, passing CI, and aligned with current design, review it as the first option.
   - Merge it before the refactor when that reduces conflict risk.
   - Preserve the contributor's commits and attribution unless the contributor agrees to a squash or rework.

3. Request a rebase when needed:
   - Ask for a rebase if the PR is still valid but conflicts with main or depends on code that has moved.
   - Give concrete instructions about the new target files or APIs.
   - Do not rewrite the same work in parallel while waiting unless there is a release blocker or security issue.

4. Preserve tests and intent:
   - Treat contributor tests as part of the contribution, not optional scaffolding.
   - If a refactor supersedes implementation code, port the tests or explain why they are invalid.
   - Keep user-facing behavior, docs examples, and regression coverage intact unless the PR is explicitly changing the contract.

5. Close superseded PRs with explicit rationale:
   - Close only after commenting with the replacement commit, PR, or issue.
   - Explain what was preserved, what changed, and why the original branch will not be merged.
   - Thank the contributor and invite follow-up if their use case was not fully covered.

6. Leave an audit trail:
   - Link the intake decision from the refactor PR or Beads issue.
   - Record any follow-up work as Beads issues instead of hidden notes.
   - Call out contributor-owned tests or behavior in the refactor PR summary.

## Code Review Process

All contributions go through code review:

1. Automated checks (tests, linting) must pass
2. At least one maintainer approval required
3. Address review feedback
4. Maintainer will merge when ready

## Development Tips

### Testing Locally

```bash
# Build and install your changes
make install

# Test specific functionality
bd init --prefix test
bd create "Test issue" -p 1 -t bug
bd dep add test-2 test-1
bd ready
```

### Database Inspection

```bash
# Inspect the Dolt database directly
bd query "SELECT * FROM issues"
bd query "SELECT * FROM dependencies"
bd query "SELECT * FROM events WHERE issue_id = 'test-1'"
```

### Updating Nix flake.lock (without nix installed)

The `flake.lock` file pins a specific nixpkgs revision. When `go.mod` bumps the Go version beyond what's in the pinned nixpkgs, the Nix CI job will fail. To update `flake.lock` without installing nix locally, use Docker:

```bash
# Update flake.lock
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/workspace -w /workspace nixos/nix \
  sh -c 'echo "experimental-features = nix-command flakes" >> /etc/nix/nix.conf && nix flake update'

# Verify the build works
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/workspace -w /workspace nixos/nix \
  sh -c 'echo "experimental-features = nix-command flakes" >> /etc/nix/nix.conf && nix build .#default && ./result/bin/bd version'
```

If the build fails with a `vendorHash` mismatch, update `default.nix` with the `got:` hash from the error message and rebuild.

The `nix build` CI job (`.github/workflows/nix-build.yml`) runs on any PR that touches `go.mod`, `go.sum`, `default.nix`, `flake.nix`, or `flake.lock`, so dependabot bumps that invalidate `vendorHash` fail loudly instead of silently breaking Nix users on main.

### Debugging

Use Go's built-in debugging tools:

```bash
# Run with verbose logging
go run ./cmd/bd -v create "Test"

# Use delve for debugging
dlv debug ./cmd/bd -- create "Test issue"
```

## Release Process

(For maintainers)

1. Update version in code
2. Update CHANGELOG.md
3. Tag release: `git tag v0.x.0`
4. Push tag: `git push origin v0.x.0`
5. GitHub Actions will build and publish
