## bd onboard

Display a minimal snippet to add to your agent instructions file for bd integration.

By default, the agent instructions file is AGENTS.md. Use 'bd init --agents-file'
to configure a different filename (e.g. BEADS.md).

This outputs a small (~10 line) snippet that points to 'bd prime' for full
workflow context. This is the same minimal profile that 'bd init' generates
by default. This approach:

  • Keeps your agent file lean (doesn't bloat with instructions)
  • bd prime provides dynamic, always-current workflow details
  • Hooks auto-inject bd prime at session start

For agents that don't support hooks (Codex, Factory, etc.), use
'bd init --agents-profile=full' to embed the complete command reference.

```
