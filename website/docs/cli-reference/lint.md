## bd lint

Check issues for missing recommended sections based on issue type.

By default, lints all open issues. Specify issue IDs to lint specific issues.

Section requirements by type:
  bug:      Steps to Reproduce, Acceptance Criteria
  task:     Acceptance Criteria
  feature:  Acceptance Criteria
  epic:     Success Criteria
  chore:    (none)

Examples:
  bd lint                    # Lint all open issues
  bd lint bd-abc             # Lint specific issue
  bd lint bd-abc bd-def      # Lint multiple issues
  bd lint --type bug         # Lint only bugs
  bd lint --status all       # Lint all issues (including closed)


```
bd lint [issue-id...] [flags]
```

**Flags:**

```
  -s, --status string   Filter by status (default: open, use 'all' for all)
  -t, --type string     Filter by issue type (bug, task, feature, epic)
```
