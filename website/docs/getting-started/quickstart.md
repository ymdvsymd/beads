# Beads Quick Start

Get up and running with Beads in 2 minutes.

## Initialize

First time in a repository:

```bash
# Basic setup (uses Dolt backend)
bd init

# For AI agents (non-interactive)
bd init --quiet

# OSS contributor (fork workflow)
bd init --contributor

# Team member (branch workflow)
bd init --team

# Protected main branch (GitHub/GitLab)
bd init --branch beads-sync
```

The wizard will:
- Create `.beads/` directory and database
- Import existing issues from git (if any)
- Prompt to install git hooks (recommended)
- Prompt to configure git merge driver (recommended)

Notes:
- Dolt stores data in `.beads/dolt/` and records `"database": "dolt"` in `.beads/metadata.json`.
- The Dolt server handles database access (`bd dolt start/stop`).

## Your First Issues

```bash
# Create a few issues
bd create "Set up database" -p 1 -t task
bd create "Create API" -p 2 -t feature
bd create "Add authentication" -p 2 -t feature

# List them
bd list
```

**Note:** Issue IDs are hash-based (e.g., `bd-a1b2`, `bd-f14c`) to prevent collisions when multiple agents/branches work concurrently.

## Hierarchical Issues (Epics)

For large features, use hierarchical IDs to organize work:

```bash
# Create epic (generates parent hash ID)
bd create "Auth System" -t epic -p 1
# Returns: bd-a3f8e9

# Create child tasks (automatically get .1, .2, .3 suffixes)
bd create "Design login UI" -p 1       # bd-a3f8e9.1
bd create "Backend validation" -p 1    # bd-a3f8e9.2
bd create "Integration tests" -p 1     # bd-a3f8e9.3

# View hierarchy
bd dep tree bd-a3f8e9
```

Output:
```
Dependency tree for bd-a3f8e9:

> bd-a3f8e9: Auth System [epic] [P1] (open)
  > bd-a3f8e9.1: Design login UI [P1] (open)
  > bd-a3f8e9.2: Backend validation [P1] (open)
  > bd-a3f8e9.3: Integration tests [P1] (open)
```

## Add Dependencies

```bash
# API depends on database
bd dep add bd-2 bd-1

# Auth depends on API
bd dep add bd-3 bd-2

# View the tree
bd dep tree bd-3
```

Output:
```
Dependency tree for bd-3:

> bd-3: Add authentication [P2] (open)
  > bd-2: Create API [P2] (open)
    > bd-1: Set up database [P1] (open)
```

## Find Ready Work

```bash
bd ready
```

Output:
```
Ready work (1 issues with no blockers):

1. [P1] bd-1: Set up database
```

Only bd-1 is ready because bd-2 and bd-3 are blocked!

## Work the Queue

```bash
# Start working on bd-1
bd update bd-1 --claim

# Complete it
bd close bd-1 --reason "Database setup complete"

# Check ready work again
bd ready
```

Now bd-2 is ready!

## Track Progress

```bash
# See blocked issues
bd blocked

# View statistics
bd stats
```

## Database Location

By default, the Dolt database is in `.beads/dolt/` (gitignored). Sync is handled via Dolt-native replication.

## Next Steps

- Add labels: `bd create "Task" -l "backend,urgent"`
- Filter ready work: `bd ready --priority 1`
- Search issues: `bd list --status open`
- Detect cycles: `bd dep cycles`
- See [CLI Reference](/cli-reference) for all commands
