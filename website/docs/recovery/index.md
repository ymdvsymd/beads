# Recovery Overview

This section provides step-by-step recovery procedures for common Beads issues. Each runbook follows a consistent format: Symptoms, Diagnosis, Solution (5 steps max), and Prevention.

## Common Issues

| Issue | Symptoms | Runbook |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Database Corruption | SQLite errors, missing data | [Database Corruption](/recovery/database-corruption) |
| Merge Conflicts | Dolt conflicts during sync | [Merge Conflicts](/recovery/merge-conflicts) |
| Circular Dependencies | Cycle detection errors | [Circular Dependencies](/recovery/circular-dependencies) |
| Sync Failures | `bd sync` errors | [Sync Failures](/recovery/sync-failures) |

## Quick Diagnostic

Before diving into specific runbooks, try these quick checks:

```bash
# Check Beads status
bd status

# Verify Dolt server is running
bd doctor

# Check for blocked issues
bd blocked
```

:::tip
Most issues can be diagnosed with `bd status`. Start there before following specific runbooks.
