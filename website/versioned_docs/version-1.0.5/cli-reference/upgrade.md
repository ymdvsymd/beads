## bd upgrade

Commands for checking bd version upgrades and reviewing changes.

The upgrade command helps you stay aware of bd version changes:
  - bd upgrade status: Check if bd version changed since last use
  - bd upgrade review: Show what's new since your last version
  - bd upgrade ack: Acknowledge the current version

Version tracking is automatic - bd updates metadata.json on every run.

```
bd upgrade
```

### bd upgrade ack

Mark the current bd version as acknowledged.

This updates metadata.json to record that you've seen the current
version. Mainly useful after reviewing upgrade changes to suppress
future upgrade notifications.

Note: Version tracking happens automatically, so you don't need to
run this command unless you want to explicitly mark acknowledgement.

Examples:
  bd upgrade ack
  bd upgrade ack --json

```
bd upgrade ack
```

### bd upgrade review

Show what's new in bd since the last version you used.

Unlike 'bd info --whats-new' which shows the last 3 versions,
this command shows ALL changes since your specific last version.

If you're upgrading from an old version, you'll see the complete
changelog of everything that changed since then.

Examples:
  bd upgrade review
  bd upgrade review --json

```
bd upgrade review
```

### bd upgrade status

Check if bd has been upgraded since you last used it.

This command uses the version tracking that happens automatically
at startup to detect if bd was upgraded.

Examples:
  bd upgrade status
  bd upgrade status --json

```
bd upgrade status
```
