## bd remember

Store a memory that persists across sessions and account rotations.

Memories are injected at prime time (bd prime) so you have them
in every session without manual loading.

Examples:
  bd remember "always run tests with -race flag"
  bd remember "Dolt phantom DBs hide in three places" --key dolt-phantoms
  bd remember "auth module uses JWT not sessions" --key auth-jwt

```
bd remember "<insight>" [flags]
```

**Flags:**

```
      --key string   Explicit key for the memory (auto-generated from content if not set). If a memory with this key already exists, it will be updated in place
```
