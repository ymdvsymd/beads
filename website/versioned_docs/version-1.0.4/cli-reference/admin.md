## bd admin

Administrative commands for beads database maintenance.

These commands are for advanced users and should be used carefully:
  cleanup   Delete closed issues (issue lifecycle)
  compact   Compact old closed issues to save space (storage optimization)
  reset     Remove all beads data and configuration (full reset)

For routine maintenance, prefer 'bd doctor --fix' which handles common repairs
automatically. Use these admin commands for targeted database operations.

```
bd admin
```

### bd admin cleanup

Delete closed issues to reduce database size.

This command permanently removes closed issues from the database.

NOTE: This command only manages issue lifecycle (closed -&gt; deleted). For general
health checks and automatic repairs, use 'bd doctor --fix' instead.

By default, deletes ALL closed issues. Use --older-than to only delete
issues closed before a certain date.

EXAMPLES:
  bd admin cleanup --force                          # Delete all closed issues
  bd admin cleanup --older-than 30 --force          # Only issues closed 30+ days ago
  bd admin cleanup --ephemeral --force              # Only closed wisps (transient molecules)
  bd admin cleanup --dry-run                        # Preview what would be deleted

SAFETY:
- Requires --force flag to actually delete (unless --dry-run)
- Supports --cascade to delete dependents
- Shows preview of what will be deleted
- Use --json for programmatic output

SEE ALSO:
  bd doctor --fix    Automatic health checks and repairs (recommended for routine maintenance)
  bd admin compact   Compact old closed issues to save space

```
bd admin cleanup [flags]
```

**Flags:**

```
      --cascade          Recursively delete all dependent issues
      --dry-run          Preview what would be deleted without making changes
      --ephemeral        Only delete closed wisps (transient molecules)
  -f, --force            Actually delete (without this flag, shows error)
      --older-than int   Only delete issues closed more than N days ago (0 = all closed issues)
```

### bd admin compact

Compact old closed issues using semantic summarization.

Compaction reduces database size by summarizing closed issues that are no longer
actively referenced. This is permanent graceful decay - original content is discarded.

Modes:
  - Analyze: Export candidates for agent review (no API key needed)
  - Apply: Accept agent-provided summary (no API key needed)
  - Auto: AI-powered compaction (requires ANTHROPIC_API_KEY or ai.api_key, legacy)
  - Dolt: Run Dolt garbage collection (for Dolt-backend repositories)

Tiers:
  - Tier 1: Semantic compression (30 days closed, 70% reduction)
  - Tier 2: Ultra compression (90 days closed, 95% reduction)

Dolt Garbage Collection:
  With auto-commit per mutation, Dolt commit history grows over time. Use
  --dolt to run Dolt garbage collection and reclaim disk space.

  --dolt: Run Dolt GC on .beads/dolt directory to free disk space.
          This removes unreachable commits and compacts storage.

Examples:
  # Dolt garbage collection
  bd compact --dolt                        # Run Dolt GC
  bd compact --dolt --dry-run              # Preview without running GC

  # Agent-driven workflow (recommended)
  bd compact --analyze --json              # Get candidates with full content
  bd compact --apply --id bd-42 --summary summary.txt
  bd compact --apply --id bd-42 --summary - &lt; summary.txt

  # Legacy AI-powered workflow
  bd compact --auto --dry-run              # Preview candidates
  bd compact --auto --all                  # Compact all eligible issues
  bd compact --auto --id bd-42             # Compact specific issue

  # Statistics
  bd compact --stats                       # Show statistics


```
bd admin compact [flags]
```

**Flags:**

```
      --actor string     Actor name for audit trail (default "agent")
      --all              Process all candidates
      --analyze          Analyze mode: export candidates for agent review
      --apply            Apply mode: accept agent-provided summary
      --auto             Auto mode: AI-powered compaction (legacy)
      --batch-size int   Issues per batch (default 10)
      --dolt             Dolt mode: run Dolt garbage collection on .beads/dolt
      --dry-run          Preview without compacting
      --force            Force compact (bypass checks, requires --id)
      --id string        Compact specific issue
      --json             Output JSON format
      --limit int        Limit number of candidates (0 = no limit)
      --stats            Show compaction statistics
      --summary string   Path to summary file (use '-' for stdin)
      --tier int         Compaction tier (1 or 2) (default 1)
      --workers int      Parallel workers (default 5)
```

### bd admin reset

Reset beads to an uninitialized state, removing all local data.

This command removes:
  - The .beads directory (database, JSONL, config)
  - Git hooks installed by bd
  - Sync branch worktrees

By default, shows what would be deleted (dry-run mode).
Use --force to actually perform the reset.

Examples:
  bd reset              # Show what would be deleted
  bd reset --force      # Actually delete everything

```
bd admin reset [flags]
```

**Flags:**

```
      --force   Actually perform the reset (required)
```
