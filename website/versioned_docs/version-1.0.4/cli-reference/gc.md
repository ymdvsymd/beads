## bd gc

Full lifecycle garbage collection for standalone Beads databases.

Runs three phases in sequence:
  1. DECAY   — Delete closed issues older than N days (default 90)
  2. COMPACT — Squash old Dolt commits into fewer commits (bd compact)
  3. GC      — Run Dolt garbage collection to reclaim disk space

Each phase can be skipped individually. Use --dry-run to preview all phases
without making changes.

Examples:
  bd gc                              # Full GC with defaults (90 day decay)
  bd gc --dry-run                    # Preview what would happen
  bd gc --older-than 30              # Decay issues closed 30+ days ago
  bd gc --skip-decay                 # Skip issue deletion, just compact+GC
  bd gc --skip-dolt                  # Skip Dolt GC, just decay+compact
  bd gc --force                      # Skip confirmation prompt

```
bd gc [flags]
