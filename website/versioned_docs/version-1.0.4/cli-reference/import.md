## bd import

Import issues from a JSONL file (newline-delimited JSON) into the database.

If no file is specified, imports from .beads/issues.jsonl (the git-tracked
export). Use "-" to read from stdin. This is the incremental counterpart to
'bd export': new issues are created and existing issues are updated (upsert
semantics).

Memory records (lines with "_type":"memory") are automatically detected and
imported as persistent memories (equivalent to 'bd remember'). This makes
'bd export | bd import' a full round-trip for both issues and memories.

Each JSONL line should map to an issue. The importer accepts every field
'bd export' emits — see 'bd export' output for the canonical schema. Only
"title" is required; everything else is optional.

Common fields:
  title                  Required. Short summary.
  description            Long-form body.
  design, notes,         Additional content sections.
    acceptance_criteria
  issue_type             bug | feature | task | epic | chore | ...
  priority               0-4 (0 = critical). 0 is preserved (no omitempty).
  status                 open | in_progress | blocked | closed | ...
                         (rows with status "tombstone" are skipped)
  assignee, owner,       Ownership metadata.
    created_by
  labels                 Array of strings.
  dependencies           Array of &#123;issue_id, depends_on_id, type, ...&#125;.
  comments               Array of comment objects.
  external_ref,          Cross-system identifiers (e.g. "gh-9").
    source_system
  due_at, defer_until    RFC3339 timestamps for scheduling.
  metadata               Arbitrary JSON object preserved verbatim.

Timestamps (created_at, updated_at, started_at, closed_at) are preserved
when present in the JSONL and otherwise filled in by the importer. The
legacy "wisp" boolean is accepted as an alias for "ephemeral".

EXAMPLES:
  bd import                        # Import from .beads/issues.jsonl
  bd import backup.jsonl           # Import from a specific file
  bd import -i backup.jsonl        # Legacy alias for a specific file
  bd import -                      # Read JSONL from stdin
  cat issues.jsonl | bd import -   # Pipe JSONL from another tool
  bd import --dry-run              # Show what would be imported
  bd import --dedup                # Skip issues with duplicate titles
  bd import --json                 # Structured output with created IDs

```
bd import [file|-] [flags]
```

**Flags:**

```
      --dedup          Skip lines whose title matches an existing open issue
      --dry-run        Show what would be imported without importing
  -i, --input string   Read JSONL from a specific file
```
