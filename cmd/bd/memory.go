Memories are injected at prime time (bd prime) so you have them
in every session without manual loading.

The positional arg is the memory CONTENT (the key is auto-generated from it
unless --key is given). As a convenience, if the arg is a bare key naming an
existing memory, it is RECALLED instead of stored (same as 'bd recall');
a bare key naming nothing is refused. Use --key to store slug-like content.

Corpus budget (opt-in, off by default): set the memories.budget-chars config
key to a byte ceiling for the whole memory corpus (sum of len(key)+len(content)).
A write that would cross it is refused, and --force overrides; a write that
lands at or above 80% of the budget warns. With the key unset nothing changes.
bd prime's --max-memory-chars also counts bytes, but of each memory as
injected, formatting included, so a budget equal to that cap does not
guarantee prime injects every memory; set the budget below it for that.

  bd remember "always run tests with -race flag"
  bd remember "Dolt phantom DBs hide in three places" --key dolt-phantoms
