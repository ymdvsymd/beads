// if the read end were garbage-collected its finalizer would close it, the

// resolve os.Stdout afresh and resume against the real stdout or the next
// test's capture. It only grows when a test fails, by two descriptors.

//
// It exists for tests whose failure mode is "never returns": the reader stops
// after captureLimit bytes, so a runaway writer blocks on the full pipe instead
// of growing a buffer until the host swaps, and os.Stdout is restored before
// the function returns, so a failing test does not leave the package's stdout
// redirected for every later test. On deadline the writer goroutine is left
// parked on the pipe.
//
// Two consequences of that design, both confined to the regression case:
// fn must write less than captureLimit bytes, since larger legitimate output
// would block on the pipe and read as a hang (the fixtures here print a
// handful of lines); and if fn is still running at the deadline, restoring
// os.Stdout races with its next read of that variable, so go test -race
// reports a data race next to the failure it already produces.
