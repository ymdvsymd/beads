// The proxied-server capability registry: one table for every command path.
//
// Before this file the policy lived in three separate tables — a maintenance
// refusal map, a history classification map, and a transform row list — each
// with its own lookup and its own front-door validator. Nothing forced a new
// command to appear in any of them, so an unclassified command sailed past the
// gate and died deep in the store factory with an untyped error. The fix is not
// a fourth table: it is one table plus a test that fails when a command is
// missing from it (TestProxyCapabilityRegistryCoversCommandTree).
//
// WHAT A ROW MEANS. Outcome describes what the PRE-PROVIDER GATE does with the
// path on a proxied-server workspace, nothing more:
//
//	ProxyOutcomeRefused        the gate refuses with a typed ProxyCapabilityError
//	                           before any workspace side effect
//	ProxyOutcomeRefusedInRunE  the gate lets the path through and the command
//	                           refuses inside its own RunE with an untyped
//	                           string; recorded here so the untyped surface is
//	                           inventoried rather than invisible. Not enforced.
//	ProxyOutcomeHonored        the gate lets the path through. It does NOT
//	                           promise a proxied route exists: a permitted
//	                           command with no route still fails at the store
//	                           factory with proxy.store.unrouted.
//
// Permitting a path also COSTS something, and the cost is invisible from this
// table: unless the command is on one of main.go's store-init skip lists, the
// root pre-run opens the proxied provider before RunE runs — which starts the
// proxy and its dolt child, creates the database and migrates the schema. For a
// command that genuinely uses the store that is the point. For a store-free one
// it is pure side effect, and on a workspace whose topology cannot be resolved
// it turns a clean typed refusal into a provider-open error. So "this command
// touches no store" is an argument for permitting it only once the command is
// also off the store-init path; see the `migrate hooks` row. Nothing here
// asserts that, and TestProxyCapabilityRegistryCoversCommandTree cannot see it.
//
// REASON is the load-bearing field. "design" means refusing is correct and is
// expected to stay that way — the semantics are undefined or unsafe against a
// backend that may be shared. "unimplemented" means the refusal is a capability
// gap with a named slice that closes it, and Tracking says which. Every later
// slice measures itself by turning "unimplemented" rows into honored ones; the
// count of remaining "unimplemented" rows is the completion signal for the whole
// proxied-parity effort. Assign the field row by row, from the command's actual
// semantics — a bulk assignment would destroy the only information it carries.
//
// The reason also renders in the refusal JSON, additive to the frozen
// {code, error, mutates} contract (see buildJSONCapabilityError). Codes are
// frozen; messages are informative-only.

// ProxyRefusalReason distinguishes a deliberate policy refusal from a
// not-yet-built one.
