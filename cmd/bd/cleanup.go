var cleanupCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "cleanup",
	Short: "Delete closed issues to reduce database size",
	Long: `Delete closed issues to reduce database size.

This command permanently removes closed issues from the database.

NOTE: This command only manages issue lifecycle (closed -> deleted). For general
health checks and automatic repairs, use 'bd doctor --fix' instead.

By default, deletes ALL closed issues. Use --older-than to only delete
issues closed before a certain date.

EXAMPLES:
  bd admin cleanup --force                          # Delete all closed issues
  bd admin cleanup --older-than 30 --force          # Only issues closed 30+ days ago
  bd admin cleanup --ephemeral --force              # Only closed wisps (transient molecules)
  bd admin cleanup --dry-run                        # Preview what would be deleted

SAFETY:
- Requires --force flag to actually delete (unless --dry-run)
- Supports --cascade to delete dependents
- Shows preview of what will be deleted
- Use --json for programmatic output
