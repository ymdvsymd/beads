	Short: "Serve the beads HTTP API over loopback",
	Long: `Serve the beads HTTP API — the same work surface the CLI answers, for
automation clients that would otherwise fork a bd subprocess per call.

The wire contract is described by an OpenAPI document (/v0); GET
/v0/beads/context reports which operations this build actually implements.

DEPLOYMENT

  Pass an explicit port. The default 127.0.0.1:0 takes an ephemeral one, which
  is right for ad-hoc and test use — where the bound address printed on stdout
  is read immediately — but carries no mutual exclusion: two serves against one
  workspace then run side by side on different ports with no way to enumerate
  them. On a fixed port the second one fails to bind, which is the intended
  behavior. Concurrent serves are data-safe either way; claims are arbitrated
  in the SQL server.

  Run it under a supervisor. bd shuts down gracefully on SIGHUP as well as
  SIGINT and SIGTERM, so closing the terminal of a foreground bd serve stops it.

PROBES

  GET /healthz is LIVENESS only: it answers from the process and never touches
  the database, so it stays green while the database is unreachable. For
  readiness use GET /v0/beads/ready?limit=1 — a real query, where 200 means
  ready and 503 means live but not ready.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO

  No authentication and no TLS. The trust model is the loopback boundary, which
  is the same one the database behind it already relies on. --allow-non-loopback
  extends the surface to every network peer that can reach the address; nothing
  else about the server changes.

  Hooks do not fire. A hook is a user-controlled subprocess per mutation: in a
  concurrent server that is an unbounded latency multiplier and an orphaned
  child at shutdown, and its working-directory-derived hook lookup is
  meaningless in a server process. A CLI claim runs on_update; an HTTP claim
  does not.

  The per-command auto-commit machinery does not run. Durability is per request:
  a successful claim commits inside its own transaction, exactly as a proxied
  CLI claim does today.

  An actor on an HTTP request is caller-asserted provenance for the audit trail,
  not authenticated identity — the same thing it has always been on the CLI,
  where any local process can pass any --actor.

  It does not run under --readonly, and refuses to start rather than binding.
  Every server it binds publishes the issue-claim operation, and the capability
  set it advertises is a property of the build rather than of the flags on the
  process that started it — so a read-only server would advertise a write it
  could never land.

DESTRUCTIVE OPERATIONS

  POST /v0/beads/issues:sweep deletes closed beads in bulk — the operation
  behind bd purge and bd prune — and nothing it deletes comes back. It shares
  the library surface those commands call, so it inherits their guards: pinned
  beads are never swept, and a durable sweep with neither a cutoff nor an id
  pattern is refused rather than clearing every closed bead in the workspace.
  Combined with the trust model above, that means anyone who can reach this
  address can erase closed work; bind it accordingly.`,

//     (the capability set is derived from the route table and knows nothing

//     the workspace's connection settings, which carries no read-only posture,
//     so `--readonly` bought the operator nothing and every claim landed.
//     (Proxied mode never got here: the root pre-run already refuses strict
