# Beads Community Tools

A curated list of community-built UIs, extensions, and integrations for Beads. Ranked by activity and maturity.

> **Note:** Beads uses a Dolt SQL database for storage. Tools should use
> the `bd` CLI (`bd list --json`, etc.) to access data. Tools that read
> the old `.beads/issues.jsonl` format directly are not compatible with
> current versions.
