# Documentation Disposition Inventory

Reviewed: 2026-05-08

Scope: every Markdown file under `docs/`, including `adr/`, `design/`,
`design/otel/`, and the staged-for-removal bin.

Evidence bar: retained factual claims must be backed by current CLI behaviour,
current tests, or code that is used by the product. Reference-shaped docs either
need generated/checkable maintenance, or an explicit `Last reviewed:` marker and
freshness source.

## Canonical Seams

| Seam | Canonical docs | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| Architecture | `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `INTERNALS.md`, `DOLT.md`, `adr/`, `design/` | Durable structure, package boundaries, storage model, and invariants live here. |
| Behaviour/reference | `CLI_REFERENCE.md`, `CONFIG.md`, `SETUP.md`, `JSON_SCHEMA.md`, `RECOVERY.md`, `ERROR_HANDLING.md`, `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` | CLI/config/runtime contracts live here and need generation or freshness review. |
| User-facing workflow | `INSTALLING.md`, `QUICKSTART.md`, `FAQ.md`, `SYNC_SETUP.md`, integration guides, `WORKTREES.md`, `UNINSTALLING.md` | Task-oriented user docs live here; avoid duplicating implementation tables unless linked to reference docs. |
| Maintainer/operator | root `RELEASING.md`, `RELEASE-STABILITY-GATE.md`, `LINTING.md`, `SECURITY-DEPENDENCY-EXCEPTIONS.md`, `PERFORMANCE_TESTING.md` | Maintainer process docs stay active only when tied to current scripts/checks. |
| Historical/staged | `staged-for-removal/` | Resolved audits, stale duplicates, and unsupported snapshots are preserved here until deleted or rescued. |

## Reference Freshness

| Doc | Freshness path |
|---|---|
| `CLI_REFERENCE.md` | Generated from `bd help --all`. |
| `CONFIG.md` | `Last reviewed:` marker tied to `cmd/bd/main.go`, `cmd/bd/config.go`, and `internal/configfile/`. |
| `SETUP.md` | `Last reviewed:` marker tied to `cmd/bd/setup*.go` and `internal/recipes/`. |
| `ADO_CONFIG.md` | `Last reviewed:` marker tied to `cmd/bd/ado*.go` and `internal/ado/`. |
| `JSON_SCHEMA.md` | `Last reviewed:` marker tied to `cmd/bd/output.go`, `cmd/bd/errors.go`, and protocol tests. |
| `RECOVERY.md` | `Last reviewed:` marker tied to `cmd/bd/init*.go` safety code and tests. |
| `ERROR_HANDLING.md` | `Last reviewed:` marker tied to current command error exits and JSON error helpers. |
| `LINTING.md` | `Last reviewed:` marker tied to `.golangci.yml` and current lint output. |
| `design/otel/otel-data-model.md` | `Last reviewed:` marker tied to telemetry, Dolt storage, hooks, and AI call sites. |

Follow-up automation should replace marker-only checks with generated or
`--check` blocks where a clean code source exists.
