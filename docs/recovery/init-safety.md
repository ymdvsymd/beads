description: Step-by-step recovery for bd init and bd dolt push/pull refusals, including the primary-key fork playbook

Last reviewed: 2026-10-01

Freshness source: `cmd/bd/init.go`, `cmd/bd/init_safety.go`,
`cmd/bd/init_safety_test.go`, `cmd/bd/init_safety_help.go`, and
`cmd/bd/dolt.go`.

This document lives next to the ADRs and matches the structure of `bd`'s
error messages: each named refusal in `bd init` and `bd dolt push`/`pull`
has a labeled anchor here with step-by-step recovery instructions. The
`bd dolt push`/`pull` fork refusal deep-links its anchor directly; since
[#5310](https://github.com/gastownhall/beads/pull/5310) the `bd init`
refusals point at `bd help init-safety`, which links this document as a
whole — match those by exit code and symptom text.

## init-force-refused

**Exit code:** `10` (`ExitRemoteDivergenceRefused`)

**Symptom**

```
bd init refuses: remote 'origin' already has Dolt history (refs/dolt/data).
  Why: this init mode would create or reuse local history instead of
       adopting the remote. ...
```

**Why this happens**

`bd init --force` (or `--reinit-local`) tells `bd` to bypass the local
data-safety guard, and only that guard: neither flag bypasses this refusal
or the [missing server-side database refusal](#init-missing-server-db).
`bd init --from-jsonl` selects a local JSONL export as the source. But the
remote already has project history. Proceeding would create an orphan local
Dolt branch with no common ancestor on origin. The
next `bd dolt push` would either fail (no common ancestor) or — worse, if
force-pushed — destroy the team's data.

**Recovery paths**

Pick the one that matches your intent.

### 1. You want to adopt the remote's history (most common)

```
bd bootstrap
```

This clones the remote's Dolt database into a fresh local `.beads/`.
Your local state is ignored; the team's history becomes yours.

If you set aside the old `.beads/dolt` instead of deleting it, or `bd list`
fails right after this with `table not found: leases`, see
[re-clone-gotchas](#re-clone-gotchas) below before you do anything else.

### 2. You want to diagnose what went wrong before deciding

```
bd doctor
bd dolt status
```

`bd doctor` walks the local + remote state and names concrete problems.
`bd dolt status` shows the Dolt-level view. Neither modifies anything.

### 3. You intentionally want to overwrite the remote's history (destructive)

This is a cross-boundary operation that affects every collaborator. You
need to pair the local-source init (`--reinit-local` or `--from-jsonl`)
with `--discard-remote`. In interactive mode `bd` will prompt for
confirmation; in non-interactive mode you must supply a `--destroy-token`.
See `bd help init-safety` for the token format.

After `bd init --reinit-local --discard-remote`, your next
`bd dolt push` must be a history-replacing push. Coordinate with your
team before doing this.

---

## init-token-missing

**Exit code:** `12` (`ExitDestroyTokenMissing`)

**Symptom**

```
bd init refuses: --discard-remote requires an explicit destroy-token in non-interactive mode.
```

Or, re-initializing over existing local issues with no TTY:

```
Refusing to destroy N issues in non-interactive mode.
  See 'bd help init-safety' for the required --destroy-token format.
```

**Why this happens**

You're running non-interactively (CI, agent, piped input) and asked for a
destructive re-init. Destructive operations cannot be authorized silently,
so `bd` requires `--destroy-token` in place of the interactive confirmation
it cannot prompt for.

Both destructive paths need the token, not just the cross-boundary one:

- `--discard-remote`, which would discard the remote's Dolt history.
- plain `--reinit-local` over existing local issues, which would destroy
  them (see [init-local-exists](#init-local-exists)).

**Recovery paths**

### 1. Run interactively

Re-run in a TTY. `bd init --reinit-local --discard-remote` will prompt
you to type the destroy-token at confirmation time.

### 2. Supply the token explicitly (CI/automation)

The token format is `DESTROY-<issue-prefix>`. For a project whose issue
prefix is `bd`:

```
# Destroys local issues only:
bd init --reinit-local --destroy-token=DESTROY-bd

# Also discards the remote's Dolt history:
bd init --reinit-local --discard-remote --destroy-token=DESTROY-bd
```

Automation should template the token from project state, not from error
output. See [ADR 0002 — Invariant 4](https://github.com/gastownhall/beads/blob/main/engdocs/adr/0002-init-safety-invariants.md)
for why the token is never echoed in `bd`'s error messages.

---

## init-local-exists

**Exit code:** `11` (`ExitLocalExistsRefused`) interactively;
`12` (`ExitDestroyTokenMissing`) non-interactively

**Symptom**

Interactive (TTY): you declined the typed `destroy N issues` confirmation.
This is the only path that exits `11`.

```
Type 'destroy N issues' to confirm:
Aborted. Database was NOT modified.
```

Non-interactive (CI, agent, piped input) — note this exits `12`, not `11`:

```
Refusing to destroy N issues in non-interactive mode.
  See 'bd help init-safety' for the required --destroy-token format.
```

**Why this happens**

Local `.beads/` has existing issues. `bd init --reinit-local` (or its
deprecated alias `--force`) would permanently destroy them, so `bd` demands
an explicit confirmation first: the typed prompt in a TTY, and a
`--destroy-token` when there is no TTY. This applies to `--reinit-local` on
its own — `--discard-remote` is not required to trigger it.

A plain `bd init` over an initialized workspace does not reach either code:
the local-safety guard refuses it with an ordinary error before this point.

**Recovery paths**

### 1. Export first, then proceed

```
bd export > issue-export.jsonl

# Interactive: confirm at the typed prompt.
bd init --reinit-local

# Non-interactive: the token stands in for the prompt. Without it this
# re-runs straight back into the exit-12 refusal above.
bd init --reinit-local --destroy-token=DESTROY-<issue-prefix>
```

`issue-export.jsonl` lets you re-import individual issues if needed. It is not
a full database backup; use `bd backup` when the Dolt database is healthy
enough to create a restorable backup before reinitializing.

### 2. Investigate why you hit this

If you did NOT expect `bd init` to be the right command here, run
`bd doctor` first — you may be looking at a server config issue that a
re-init won't fix.

## init-missing-server-db

**Symptom**

```
⚠ Database "myproject" not found on server at 127.0.0.1:3306 (or the server could not be reached to confirm).
This workspace was already initialized (metadata.json has a project_id from a prior
bd init), so this looks like a recovery situation, not a fresh clone
...
bd init will NOT create an empty database here — that would strand any existing
issue data behind a new, empty database of the same name.
```

**What happened**

This workspace is in server mode and shows evidence of a prior `bd init`:
`.beads/metadata.json` carries a `project_id`, or (under `--reinit-local` or
`--force`) a workspace that predates `project_id` still has a local Dolt data
directory, in which case the message cites that instead of `metadata.json`.
Yet its configured database is not on the server, or the server could not be
reached to confirm.

That is treated as a **recovery** situation, not a fresh clone, and the two are
otherwise indistinguishable from the local filesystem alone: this project's own
database directory is absent either way, because it was never created here or
because it was lost with the local storage. `bd init` used to resolve the
ambiguity by assuming "fresh clone" and creating the database. When the
assumption was wrong, the result was a new, empty database sitting at the name
the real one used to occupy — the 2026-08-11 fleet-wide data loss.

`bd init` now refuses instead, and the refusal is **not** bypassed by
`--force` or `--reinit-local`. Those flags authorize destroying a database
that exists; they do not authorize inventing an empty one where the configured
database has gone missing.

### 1. Find out where the database went (do this first)

```
bd doctor          # check project health
bd dolt status     # inspect Dolt server state
```

A stopped server, a server started on the wrong port, or a wrong `--data-dir`
all present exactly like this — and none of them need a re-init. Fixing the
server brings the data back untouched.

### 2. Restore from an export

```
bd backup restore                  # if a local backup snapshot exists
```

Also check `.beads/backup/` for a JSONL export you can import manually.

### 3. Create a fresh empty database at this name

**Destructive to any unrecovered data.**

Only when you are certain no recoverable data exists:

```
bd init --recreate-missing --prefix myproject
```

`--recreate-missing` is per-invocation only. It is deliberately never implied
by `--force`, `--reinit-local`, a config key, or an environment variable,
because it authorizes the one thing this guard exists to prevent.

The refusal names `--recreate-missing` but does not print this command: it also
fires when the server merely could not be reached, so it sends you through
steps 1 and 2 here instead of handing you a line to paste. See
[ADR 0002 — Invariant 4](https://github.com/gastownhall/beads/blob/main/engdocs/adr/0002-init-safety-invariants.md).

**Limits worth knowing**

Whether a workspace meets this refusal depends on two pieces of local
evidence: whether this project's own database directory
(`<dolt-data-dir>/<database>/.dolt`) exists, and whether `metadata.json`
carries a `project_id` (introduced by GH#2372). With the configured database
missing from the server, or the server unreachable:

| Local Dolt storage | `project_id` | `bd init` | `bd init --reinit-local` / `--force` |
|---|---|---|---|
| This project's database directory present | Either | Refused as already initialized, not by this guard | Not this guard; the ordinary re-init path |
| Data dir present, database directory absent | Present | This refusal | This refusal |
| Data dir present, database directory absent | Absent | Refused as already initialized, not by this guard | This refusal |
| No Dolt data dir | Present | This refusal | This refusal |
| No Dolt data dir | Absent | Proceeds, as for a fresh clone | Proceeds, as for a fresh clone |

Adding `--recreate-missing` lifts every refusal in the last four rows,
including the third row's "already initialized". It changes nothing in the
first row, where this project's database is still on local disk. In
shared-server mode the data dir is machine-global (see below), so the last two
rows rarely apply there.

- `project_id` is also inherited by a **fresh clone**, because
  `.beads/metadata.json` is git-tracked by default. Cloning a beads-managed
  repo whose server-side database does not exist yet therefore meets this
  refusal rather than a plain first init. It fails in the safe direction —
  nothing is created silently, and no existing data can be stranded — and
  `--recreate-missing` above is the supported way through it. This is settled,
  not pending: `engdocs/adr/0004-missing-database-guard-signal.md` records why
  no purely-local signal can replace `project_id` here (absence of local state
  cannot tell "never initialized here" from "initialized here, storage since
  lost"), and why `--recreate-missing` is the permanent resolution path rather
  than a stopgap.
- Server mode only, and shared-server mode counts as server mode — the guard
  tests for *this project's* database directory under the resolved Dolt data
  dir, not for the data dir itself, which in shared mode is the machine-global
  `~/.beads/shared-server/dolt` that is created on demand.
- Proxied-server mode does not reach the `--reinit-local`/`--force` guard —
  the `--proxied-server` dispatch in `runInit` (`cmd/bd/init.go`) returns
  before it. It does reach the plain-init guard, because
  `runInitProxiedServer` calls `checkExistingBeadsData`, so
  **`--recreate-missing` works under `--proxied-server` too**: the flag is
  assigned beside its flag read, upstream of every dispatch in `runInit`.
  Keep it there. It was previously assigned next to the guard it gates, which
  is downstream of the proxied dispatch, and the flag was therefore inert on
  that one route while the refusal still told the operator to pass it.
- `bd bootstrap` has its own separate mode-blind create path.

## pk-fork-refused

**Symptom**

```
$ bd dolt pull
Error: ... cannot merge because table dependencies has different primary keys in its common ancestor
```

(or the variant without `in its common ancestor`). `bd` follows the error
with a short version of the recovery recipe below.

**Why this happens**

The two histories being merged disagree about a table's *primary key set* —
not about row contents. Dolt can cell-merge rows, but it refuses outright to
merge a table whose primary key was reshaped differently on each side (or
whose common ancestor had a different primary key than both sides). The
refusal happens before any row conflicts materialize, so `bd dolt pull`'s
conflict auto-resolver never gets a chance to run. **Retrying never helps**:
the histories are permanently un-mergeable.

The usual cause is upgrading `bd` independently on two clones while un-synced
changes existed on both sides, across a release whose schema migrations
reshape a primary key. Concretely: the
[#4259](https://github.com/gastownhall/beads/issues/4259) incident — clones
straddling the `0041`/`0043`/`0050` reshapes of `dependencies` (v1.0.4 →
v1.0.6) hit exactly this on the first post-upgrade pull if both sides had
unpushed dependency edits.

The remote-migrate prevention gate (v1.0.6+) exists to stop this from being
created: it refuses to auto-migrate a remote-backed database and tells you to
designate a single migrator. This playbook is for when the fork already
exists.

**Recovery: bootstrap from one canonical clone**

The forked histories cannot be merged, so one side must be chosen as
canonical and every other clone re-cloned from it. Issue *data* survives via
JSONL export/import; only the un-mergeable Dolt *history* is discarded on the
non-canonical clones.

### 1. Pick the canonical clone

Usually the most complete / most recently active clone. To compare, run on
each clone (read-only):

```
bd stats
bd dolt status
```

### 2. On the canonical clone: upgrade, migrate, force-push

```
bd version                 # confirm the new bd binary
bd doctor                  # sanity-check before publishing
bd dolt push --force       # make the remote authoritative
```

(`bd`'s migration gate may block here; that is exactly the designated-migrator
case the gate is asking about — follow the guidance it prints on the canonical
clone.)

### 3. On EVERY other clone: save local-only work, re-clone, re-apply

```
bd export --all -o /tmp/beads-local.jsonl    # safety net for un-synced work
rm -rf .beads/dolt                           # discard the un-mergeable history
bd bootstrap                                 # re-clone from the remote
bd import /tmp/beads-local.jsonl             # re-apply local-only work
```

`bd import` has upsert semantics: issues that only existed on this clone are
re-created, newer local edits are applied, and rows older than what the
remote already has are skipped. Spot-check with `bd stats` afterwards.

Doing this by hand (moving `.beads/dolt` aside instead of `rm -rf`, or
skipping straight to `bd list`) can hit either of two live gotchas — see
[re-clone-gotchas](#re-clone-gotchas) below.

### Prevention (upgrades across PK-reshaping migrations)

- **Sync before upgrading**: `bd dolt push` + `bd dolt pull` on every clone
  while all clones still run the *old* version, then stop editing. Once the new
  binary is installed, `bd dolt push`/`bd dolt pull` are gated too, so this must
  happen first. The one exception is the *data-behind* stop — a clone level on
  schema but missing commits the remote has — where `bd dolt pull` **is** the
  remedy and is allowed through; the gate says so when it fires, and
  [Clone behind the remote](/getting-started/upgrading#clone-behind-the-remote)
  has the recipe. Plan for the rule, not the exception.
- **One designated migrator**: upgrade one machine, let it migrate, then
  `bd dolt push`.
- **Every other clone adopts, does not pull**: after the migrator pushes, each
  other clone upgrades the binary and runs `bd bootstrap` to adopt the migrated
  database. `bd dolt pull` is *refused* while the clone still has pending
  migrations, so do not rely on it; the "sync before" step above is what
  preserves these clones' work, because `bd bootstrap` replaces the local
  database.

---

## re-clone-gotchas

Two gotchas hit during a live manual re-clone recovery (issue ga-vrq5pu),
each of which cost real time because the symptom looks nothing like the
cause. Both
apply any time you set aside or replace a Dolt database directory by hand —
during the [pk-fork-refused](#pk-fork-refused) playbook above, the
[init-force-refused](#init-force-refused) `bd bootstrap` path, or any other
manual re-clone.

### Gotcha 1 — a damaged/set-aside store must go OUTSIDE data_dir

**Symptom**

```
root hash doesn't exist: <hash>
```

...printed repeatedly as the Dolt sql-server crash-loops under its
supervisor/watchdog. Nothing in that message mentions a stray directory, so
it does not look like "you left a directory lying around."

**Why this happens**

The sql-server treats *every* subdirectory of its `data_dir` (default
`.beads/dolt/`, overridable via `BEADS_DOLT_DATA_DIR` or the `dolt_data_dir`
field in `metadata.json`) as its own database and tries to load it. If you
move a damaged or superseded database directory aside but leave it *inside*
`data_dir` (for example, renaming `.beads/dolt/mydb` to
`.beads/dolt/mydb.bak` instead of moving it out of `.beads/dolt/`
entirely), the server tries to load the damaged copy too and dies on it —
even though the healthy database sitting right next to it is fine.

Check which mode you are in before you go looking for `data_dir`: in shared
server mode (`BEADS_DOLT_SHARED_SERVER=1`, or the `dolt.shared-server` config
key) it is `~/.beads/shared-server/dolt/` — or `$BEADS_SHARED_SERVER_DIR/dolt/`
— and that takes precedence over both of the per-project knobs above. That is
also where this gotcha bites hardest: one shared `data_dir` holds every
project's database on the machine, so a single stray subdirectory crash-loops
the server for all of them.

**The fix**

When you set a database directory aside by hand, move it *outside*
`data_dir` — e.g. up to `/tmp/` or a sibling of `.beads/`, never to a
sibling path still under `.beads/dolt/`.

Do not wait for an automated repair to do it for you: no `bd doctor --fix`
repair performs this move here. The two that come closest are:

- The **corrupt-manifest repair** renames the damaged database's own
  `.dolt/` directory *in place* — `<data_dir>/<db>/.dolt` →
  `<data_dir>/<db>/.dolt.<ts>.corrupt.backup` — and reinitializes beside
  it, so in the standard `<data_dir>/<db>/` layout the backup is nested
  inside the database directory rather than becoming a new direct child of
  `data_dir`. It also fires only once its scan can prove the store holds no
  recoverable chunk data, so it will not touch the superseded-but-populated
  copy this gotcha is about (`internal/doltserver/manifest_recovery.go`).
- The rename that *does* move a whole `data_dir` to a timestamped sibling
  (`data_dir` → `data_dir.<ts>.corrupt.backup`) belongs to a different
  repair, the database-integrity recovery
  (`cmd/bd/doctor/fix/database_integrity.go`) — and that one refuses
  outright for a repo configured in Dolt server mode, so if the
  crash-looping server is your configured backend it is unavailable too.

Make the move by hand, and make sure it lands outside `data_dir`.

### Gotcha 2 — a fresh clone needs `bd migrate schema`

**Symptom**

```
table not found: leases
```

(or a similar "table not found" error for `wisps`, `events`,
`local_metadata`, or another clone-local table). A supervisor or agent
harness that expects to load session beads right after a fresh clone fails
here.

**Why this happens**

A handful of tables — `leases`, `wisps`, `wisp_*`, `events`, `bd_events_*`,
`local_metadata`, `ignored_schema_migrations`, `repo_mtimes` — are
dolt-ignored, clone-local tables: they exist on a running database but are
deliberately excluded from what `bd dolt push`/`pull`/clone transfers, so a
fresh clone starts without them.

A writable open normally re-materializes them on its own, whether it is
embedded or reaches the database through a server or proxied sql-server: it
runs the schema migration pass, which replays the clone-local ("ignored")
series whenever that series' cursor table is behind — and the cursor table,
`ignored_schema_migrations`, is itself clone-local, so a fresh clone always
qualifies (`internal/storage/schema/schema.go`,
`internal/storage/uow/dolt_sql_provider.go`). Reaching the error above
therefore means the open that hit it was *not* one of those self-healing
opens. The kinds that skip the pass, or only verify, include a deliberately
non-mutating read-only or preview open, a team-server open (it checks the
schema rather than migrating it), the preview-attach path, and any open whose
open-time migration gate refused. Run the migration explicitly to close the
gap.

**The fix**

```
bd migrate schema
```

No `--force` needed. This replays the clone-local tables and prints:

```
✓ Schema already at v<N>
```

**That output is expected and reassuring, not an error** — it means the
*versioned* schema was already current; the clone-local tables have now
been (re)created regardless. Run this once after any fresh clone or
`bd bootstrap`, before relying on `bd list` or any other command that reads
session state.
