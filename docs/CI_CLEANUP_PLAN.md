# CI Cleanup Plan

Last reviewed: 2026-05-28

Freshness source: `docs/CI_TEST_SURFACE_AUDIT.md`, `.github/workflows/*.yml`,
`.buildflags`, `.golangci.yml`, package test manifests, and maintainer decision
review on 2026-05-28.

This document records the agreed target shape for CI cleanup. It is the policy
and roadmap layer; the current inventory remains in
[`CI_TEST_SURFACE_AUDIT.md`](CI_TEST_SURFACE_AUDIT.md).

## Goals

- Make every important CI tier reproducible through a repository-owned command.
- Keep PR checks fast, required, and Linux-only unless risk justifies more.
- Run expensive platform and integration coverage on `main`, manual dispatch, or
  scheduled background jobs after measuring wall-clock cost.
- Make release/package checks rerun release-critical validation before
  publishing, independent of earlier `main` success.
- Preserve current behavior first, then measure and promote additional suites.

## Non-Goals

- Do not make `.test-skip` part of CI. It is a local human optimization file.
- Do not run macOS or Windows checks on PRs by default.
- Do not make Codecov/upload success block PRs or `main`.
- Do not broaden `pull_request_target` usage for package validation.

## Tier Model

| Tier | Trigger | Required | Platform | Purpose |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| `pr-core` | Every PR and merge queue run | Yes | Linux | Fast baseline Go validation for the shipped default path. |
| `pr-policy` | Every PR and merge queue run | Yes | Linux | Repository policy checks that should fail before expensive tests matter. |
| `pr-lint` | Every PR and merge queue run | Yes | Linux | Required `gofmt` and `golangci-lint` gate. |
| `pr-risk-*` | PRs matching risky paths or maintainer labels | Yes when applicable | Linux | Descriptive risk checks such as embedded, regression, Nix, packages, and release paths. |
| `main-*` | Every push to `main` | Yes for branch health | Linux plus selected macOS/Windows | Detect after-merge issues from direct pushes and platform-specific behavior. |
| `measure-*` | Manual dispatch | No | Per suite | Collect wall-clock and sharding data before promoting suites. |
| `nightly-*` | Scheduled/manual | No, but failures require triage | Linux unless measured otherwise | Expensive background coverage not ready for every `main` push. |
| `release-*` | Tags/manual release | Yes before publish | Per artifact | Re-run release-critical checks and publish only after package gates pass. |

`merge_group` means GitHub Merge Queue. Treat it like a PR event: run Linux
`pr-core`, `pr-policy`, `pr-lint`, and the same risk checks; do not add macOS or
Windows there.

## Required PR Checks

Every PR, including docs-only PRs, should run the required Linux baseline:
`pr-core`, `pr-policy`, and `pr-lint`.

## Wrapper Conventions

Shell scripts under `scripts/ci/` are the source of truth. Make targets should
be aliases for discoverability, not a second implementation of command policy.

Wrapper rules:

- Auto-detect the repository root from the script path.
- Source `.buildflags` except for explicitly special modes such as no-CGO or
  unsupported-install checks.
- Do not require a clean worktree.
- Clean up temporary files that the wrapper creates.
- Use `scripts/ci/lib/timing.sh` for new measured command blocks.
- Keep CI-specific reporting such as `gotestsum`, JUnit, and artifacts in the
  workflow layer unless the wrapper needs to own the behavior.

### `pr-core`

Initial wrapper behavior must preserve the current Linux PR command exactly:

```bash
source ./.buildflags
go test -race -short -skip '^TestEmbedded' ./...
```

CI may wrap that command with `gotestsum` for logs and JUnit, but the underlying
test contract must remain identical during the first migration.

Additional rules:

- Use `.buildflags` so `gms_pure_go` remains the default shipped path.
- Keep `-race`.
- Keep `-short` initially only to avoid behavior drift.
- Do not generate coverage in PRs.
- Do not read `.test-skip`.

### `pr-policy`

`pr-policy` should be a separate wrapper from `pr-core`. It should include:

- Build tag policy: `scripts/check-build-tags.sh`.
- Unsupported `go install` guidance: `scripts/check-go-install-guidance.sh`.
- Version consistency: `scripts/check-versions.sh`.
- CLI flag freshness: `make check-docs` or the underlying doc flag script.
- PR guard for `.beads/issues.jsonl` changes.

### `pr-lint`

`pr-lint` is required. It should stay separate from policy so lint failures are
easy to identify and rerun. It includes:

- `make fmt-check`.
- `golangci-lint run --timeout=5m --build-tags=gms_pure_go ./...`.

Known false positives must be handled in `.golangci.yml` or with targeted
`//nolint` comments. CI should not use a tolerated failing lint baseline.

## Risk Checks

Use separate, descriptive jobs rather than one broad "extra tests" job:

- `pr-risk-embedded`
- `pr-risk-regression`
- `pr-risk-nix`
- `pr-risk-packages`
- `pr-risk-release`

Use the robust path-gated required-check pattern:

1. A detector job always runs and decides which risk checks are applicable.
2. Each required risk check reports success when it is not applicable.
3. Applicable checks fail normally on command failure.

Embedded Dolt coverage is risk-gated on PRs and always runs on `main`. Add a
maintainer `run-embedded` label and a rare maintainer-only `skip-embedded`
override. Regression coverage follows the same pattern with `run-regression`
and `skip-regression`, while still running on every `main` push.

## Main Branch Checks

`main` should run as much as practical after measurement. Direct pushes to
`main` are allowed in this repository, so after-merge detection matters.

Initial main policy:

- Re-run Linux `pr-core`.
- Run Linux coverage collection on `main`, not on PRs or merge queue.
- Run current macOS Go test shape without coverage upload:
  `go test -tags gms_pure_go -v -race -short -skip '^TestEmbedded' ./...`.
- Run Windows smoke only for now: build, `version`, and `help`.
- Run embedded Dolt every `main` push.
- Run regression every `main` push.

Candidate promotions for every `main` push must be measured first. The working
wall-clock target is about 25 minutes total. Suites that exceed that target or
create too much queue pressure should stay manual/scheduled until sharded.

No-short integration is an intended every-main candidate, not nightly-only by
policy; promote it after measurement if wall-clock data supports it.

Coverage collection should block on local coverage generation/test failures, not
on upload service failures. Do not introduce a coverage threshold during the
first promotion step.

The `main` branch may fail after merge as a cost tradeoff, but failures should
be fixed forward or reverted promptly.

## Measurement Workflow

Add a manual-dispatch workflow before changing tier breadth.

Measurement requirements:

- One sample per suite is enough initially.
- Measure per command, not only per job, so future sharding decisions have data.
- Use a shared `scripts/ci/lib/timing.sh` helper in new wrappers.
- Print timing summaries to logs and `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`.
- Preserve command exit codes; measurement jobs should fail visibly when the
  measured command fails.
- Retain artifacts for seven days.
- Pin `gotestsum`; replace current `gotestsum@latest` opportunistically when
  touching nearby workflow code.
- Use `gotestsum` for Linux Go measurement outputs. Install it one-off in the
  workflow rather than making wrappers depend on it.

Measure at least:

- Current Linux `pr-core`, policy, and lint timing.
- Current macOS short Go test command.
- macOS no-short/integration candidates.
- Linux no-short integration preserving current nightly shape:
  `BEADS_TEST_SKIP=dolt` with `-tags=integration,gms_pure_go`.
- Linux no-short integration with coverage, matching the current nightly signal.
- A cross-version smoke sample.
- Full `nix build`.
- Package checks for MCP, npm, and website.

## Package Gates

Package checks should be reusable from PR risk jobs, measurement jobs, `main`,
and release workflows.

### MCP Python Package

Build a candidate `bd` once and put it on `PATH`. Test only the `bd` binary
name, not the `beads` alias.

Wrapper command sequence:

```bash
go build -tags gms_pure_go -o /tmp/bd-mcp-test ./cmd/bd
cd integrations/beads-mcp
uv sync --all-groups
uv run ruff check src/beads_mcp tests
uv run mypy src/beads_mcp
uv run pytest --durations=50
uv build
```

### npm Package

`npm-package` currently has no lockfile, so use `npm install` until a separate
packaging cleanup adds one. Build the native binary expected by
`npm-package/bin/bd.js`, and clean it up on exit by default.

Wrapper command sequence:

```bash
go build -tags gms_pure_go -o npm-package/bin/bd ./cmd/bd
cd npm-package
npm install
npm run test:all
npm pack --dry-run
```

The existing integration test already exercises a real `npm pack`; keep both
that real pack and the explicit dry-run file-list check.

### Website

Classify `scripts/generate-llms-full.sh` as a docs/website check, not generic
policy.

Wrapper command sequence:

```bash
cd website
npm ci
npm run typecheck
cd ..
./scripts/generate-llms-full.sh
cd website
npm run build
```

Keep the internal link check in Actions through the existing Lychee workflow
step. External link checking remains non-blocking.

## Mandatory `testing.Short()` Cleanup

`-short` currently does double duty: it suppresses true slow tests and also acts
as an implicit integration/e2e tier boundary. That is mandatory cleanup before
the tier policy is considered complete.

Plan:

1. Audit every `testing.Short()` use.
2. Keep `testing.Short()` only for runtime, stress, or large-fixture skips.
3. Move integration, e2e, API, Docker, and external dependency boundaries to
   explicit build tags, environment checks, or named wrappers.
4. Update `docs/TESTING.md` after wrapper commands exist.

## Release Policy

Release/tag workflows must independently re-run release-critical checks even
when `main` was green. Publishing should happen only after package-specific
checks pass.

- Reuse `scripts/ci/package-*` wrappers in release jobs.
- MCP release may upload `dist/*` produced by the same validated `uv build`.
- npm release should explicitly build/copy the native binary needed for
  publishing; the validation wrapper should clean temporary binaries by default.
- Keep privileged automation isolated and audited. Do not broaden normal
  validation to `pull_request_target`.

## Implementation Order

1. Add `scripts/ci/*` wrappers and `scripts/ci/lib/timing.sh`; add Make aliases.
2. Wire existing workflows to wrappers with no intentional behavior drift.
3. Add the manual measurement workflow and pinned `gotestsum`.
4. Add package wrappers and risk/measurement usage for MCP, npm, and website.
5. Perform the mandatory `testing.Short()` audit and cleanup.
6. Promote measured suites to `main` or scheduled jobs based on wall-clock data.
7. Harden release workflows to reuse package wrappers before publishing.
8. Split workflows by tier/domain once wrappers are stable:
   `pr.yml`, `pr-risk.yml`, `main.yml`, `release.yml`, and `nightly.yml`.

## Deferred Decisions

- Exact branch-protection required-check names after workflow split.
- Whether no-CGO should become a full all-package gate or remain focused.
- Coverage thresholds for promoted main suites.
- Final sharding strategy for macOS, integration, and embedded jobs.
- npm lockfile policy for `npm-package`.
