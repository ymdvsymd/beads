Generated from `bd help --doc close`.

Close one or more issues.

If no issue ID is provided, closes the last touched issue (from most recent
create, update, show, or close operation).

When closing multiple issues, provide one --reason for all IDs or repeat
--reason once per ID. Reasons map positionally: the first --reason applies
to the first ID, the second --reason to the second ID, regardless of where
the flags appear in the command line.

```
bd close [id...] [flags]
