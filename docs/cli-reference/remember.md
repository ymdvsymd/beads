{/* AUTO-GENERATED: do not edit manually */}

Generated from `bd help --doc remember`.

Store a memory that persists across sessions and account rotations.

Memories are injected at prime time (bd prime) so you have them
in every session without manual loading.

The positional arg is the memory CONTENT (the key is auto-generated from it
unless --key is given). As a convenience, if the arg is a bare key naming an
existing memory, it is RECALLED instead of stored (same as 'bd recall');
a bare key naming nothing is refused. Use --key to store slug-like content.

Examples:
  bd remember "always run tests with -race flag"
  bd remember "Dolt phantom DBs hide in three places" --key dolt-phantoms
  bd remember "auth module uses JWT not sessions" --key auth-jwt
  bd remember dolt-phantoms        # bare existing key: reads it (= bd recall)

```
bd remember "<insight>" [flags]
```

**Flags:**

```
      --key string   Explicit key for the memory (auto-generated from content if not set). If a memory with this key already exists, it will be updated in place
```
