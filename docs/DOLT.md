# Dolt Backend for Beads

Beads uses Dolt as its storage backend. Dolt provides a version-controlled SQL database with cell-level merge, native branching, and two deployment modes.

## Why Dolt?

- **Native version control** — cell-level diffs and merges, not line-based
- **Multi-writer support** — server mode enables concurrent agents
- **Built-in history** — every write creates a Dolt commit
- **Native branching** — Dolt branches independent of git branches
- **Single-binary option** — embedded mode for solo users (no daemon needed)

## Getting Started

### New Project

```bash
# Embedded mode (single writer, no daemon — default for standalone)
bd init

# Server mode (multi-writer, e.g. Gas Town)
gt dolt start           # Start the Dolt server
bd init --server        # Initialize with server mode
```

### Migrate from SQLite (Legacy)

If upgrading from an older version that used SQLite:

> **Note:** The `bd migrate --to-dolt` command was removed in v0.58.0.
> For pre-0.50 installations with JSONL data, use the migration script:
>
> ```bash
> scripts/migrate-jsonl-to-dolt.sh
> ```
>
> See [Troubleshooting](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#circuit-breaker-server-appears-down-failing-fast) if you encounter connection errors after migration.

Migration creates backups automatically. Your original SQLite database is preserved as `beads.backup-pre-dolt-*.db`.

## Modes of Operation

### Embedded Mode (Solo / Standalone)

In-process Dolt engine — no separate server needed. This is the default for
standalone Beads users. The `bd` binary includes everything; just `bd init` and go.

- Single-writer (one process at a time)
- Data lives in `.beads/dolt/` alongside your code
- Push to GitHub with `bd dolt push` — code and issues in one repo
- Zero ops: no daemon, no ports, no PID files

### Server Mode (Multi-Writer / Gas Town)

Connects to a running `dolt sql-server` for multi-client access.

```bash
# Start the server (Gas Town)
gt dolt start

# Or manually
cd ~/.dolt-data/beads && dolt sql-server --port 3307
```

```yaml
# .beads/config.yaml
dolt:
  mode: server
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: 3307
  user: root
```

Server mode is required for:
- Multiple agents writing simultaneously
- Gas Town multi-rig setups
- Federation with remote peers

## Federation (Peer-to-Peer Sync)

Federation enables direct sync between Dolt installations without a central hub.

### Architecture

```
┌─────────────────┐         ┌─────────────────┐
│   Gas Town A    │◄───────►│   Gas Town B    │
│  dolt sql-server│  sync   │  dolt sql-server│
│  :3306 (sql)    │         │  :3306 (sql)    │
│  :8080 (remote) │         │  :8080 (remote) │
└─────────────────┘         └─────────────────┘
```

In federation mode, the server exposes two ports:
- **MySQL (3306)**: Multi-writer SQL access
- **remotesapi (8080)**: Peer-to-peer push/pull

### Quick Start

```bash
# Add a peer
bd federation add-peer town-beta 192.168.1.100:8080/beads

# With authentication
bd federation add-peer town-beta host:8080/beads --user sync-bot

# Sync with all peers
bd federation sync

# Handle conflicts
bd federation sync --strategy theirs  # or 'ours'

# Check status
bd federation status
```

### Topologies

| Pattern | Description | Use Case |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Hub-spoke | Central hub, satellites sync to hub | Team with central coordination |
| Mesh | All peers sync with each other | Decentralized collaboration |
| Hierarchical | Tree of hubs | Multi-team organizations |

### Credentials

Peer credentials are AES-256 encrypted, stored locally, and used automatically during sync:

```bash
# Credentials prompted interactively
bd federation add-peer name url --user admin

# Stored in federation_peers table (encrypted)
```

### Troubleshooting

```bash
# Check federation health
bd doctor --deep

# Verify peer connectivity
bd federation status
```

## Contributor Onboarding (Clone Bootstrap)

When someone clones a repository that uses Dolt backend:

1. On first `bd` command (e.g., `bd list`), bootstrap runs automatically
2. A fresh Dolt database is created
3. If a Dolt remote is configured, data is pulled from the remote
4. Work continues normally

**No manual steps required.** The bootstrap:
- Detects fresh clone (no Dolt database yet)
- Acquires a lock to prevent race conditions
- Initializes the Dolt database and pulls from configured remotes
- Creates initial Dolt commit

### Verifying Bootstrap Worked

```bash
bd list              # Should show issues
bd vc log            # Should show initial commit
```

## Troubleshooting

### Server Not Running

**Symptom:** Connection refused errors when using server mode.

```
failed to create database: dial tcp 127.0.0.1:3307: connect: connection refused
```

**Fix:**
```bash
gt dolt start        # Gas Town command
# Or
gt dolt status       # Check if running
```

### Bootstrap Not Running

**Symptom:** `bd list` shows nothing on fresh clone.

**Check:**
```bash
ls .beads/dolt/            # Should NOT exist (pre-bootstrap)
BD_DEBUG=1 bd list         # See bootstrap output
```

**Force bootstrap:**
```bash
rm -rf .beads/dolt         # Remove broken state
bd list                    # Re-triggers bootstrap
```

### Database Corruption

**Symptom:** Queries fail, inconsistent data.

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
bd doctor                  # Basic checks
bd doctor --deep           # Full validation
bd doctor --server         # Server mode checks (if applicable)
```

**Recovery options:**

1. **Repair what's fixable:**
   ```bash
   bd doctor --fix
   ```

2. **Rebuild from remote:**
   ```bash
   rm -rf .beads/dolt
   bd list                  # Re-triggers bootstrap
   ```

### Lock Contention (Embedded Mode)

**Symptom:** "database is locked" errors.

Embedded mode is single-writer. If you need concurrent access:

```bash
# Switch to server mode
gt dolt start
bd config set dolt.mode server
```

## Configuration Reference

```yaml
# .beads/config.yaml

# Dolt settings
dolt:
  # Auto-commit Dolt history after writes (default: on for embedded, off for server)
  auto-commit: on        # on | off

  # Server mode settings (when mode: server)
  mode: embedded         # embedded | server
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: 3307
  user: root
  # Password via BEADS_DOLT_PASSWORD env var
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `BEADS_DOLT_PASSWORD` | Server mode password |
| `BEADS_DOLT_SERVER_MODE` | Enable server mode (set to "1") |
| `BEADS_DOLT_SERVER_HOST` | Server host (default: 127.0.0.1) |
| `BEADS_DOLT_SERVER_PORT` | Server port (default: 3307) |
| `BEADS_DOLT_SERVER_TLS` | Enable TLS (set to "1" or "true") |
| `BEADS_DOLT_SERVER_USER` | MySQL connection user |
| `DOLT_REMOTE_USER` | Push/pull auth user |
| `DOLT_REMOTE_PASSWORD` | Push/pull auth password |
| `BD_DOLT_AUTO_COMMIT` | Override auto-commit setting |

## Dolt Version Control

Dolt maintains its own version history, separate from Git:

```bash
# View Dolt commit history
bd vc log

# Show diff between Dolt commits
bd vc diff HEAD~1 HEAD

# Create manual checkpoint
bd vc commit -m "Checkpoint before refactor"
```

### Auto-Commit Behavior

In **embedded mode** (standalone default), each `bd` write command creates a Dolt commit:

```bash
bd create "New issue"    # Creates issue + Dolt commit
```

In **server mode** (Gas Town), auto-commit defaults to OFF because the server
manages its own transaction lifecycle. Firing `DOLT_COMMIT` after every write
under concurrent load causes 'database is read only' errors.

Override for batch operations (embedded) or explicit commits (server):

```bash
bd --dolt-auto-commit off create "Issue 1"
bd --dolt-auto-commit off create "Issue 2"
bd vc commit -m "Batch: created issues"
```

## Server Management (Gas Town)

Gas Town provides integrated Dolt server management:

```bash
gt dolt start            # Start server (background)
gt dolt stop             # Stop server
gt dolt status           # Show server status
gt dolt logs             # View server logs
gt dolt sql              # Open SQL shell
```

Server runs on port 3307 (avoids MySQL conflict on 3306).

### Data Location (Gas Town)

```
~/gt/.dolt-data/
├── hq/                  # Town beads (hq-*)
├── gastown/             # Gastown rig (gt-*)
├── beads/               # Beads rig (bd-*)
├── wyvern/              # Wyvern rig (wy-*)
└── sky/                 # Sky rig (sky-*)
```

## Migration Cleanup

After successful migration from SQLite, you may have backup files:

```
.beads/beads.backup-pre-dolt-20260122-213600.db
.beads/sqlite.backup-pre-dolt-20260123-192812.db
```

These are safe to delete once you've verified Dolt is working:

```bash
# Verify Dolt works
bd list
bd doctor

# Then clean up (after appropriate waiting period)
rm .beads/*.backup-*.db
```

**Recommendation:** Keep backups for at least a week before deleting.
