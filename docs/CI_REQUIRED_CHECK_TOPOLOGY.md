# Required Check Topology

Status: design proposal. Do not change branch protection until the workflow
changes below have landed and the new check has appeared on at least one recent
commit.

## Problem

GitHub branch protection should require one stable PR gate while still letting
CI skip expensive risk checks on low-risk pull requests. The required gate must
not be a path-filtered workflow or a conditionally-triggered workflow, because
GitHub leaves required checks pending when the whole workflow is skipped by
path filters, branch filters, or commit-message skip directives.

GitHub's safe distinction is:

- A skipped workflow can leave a required check pending.
- A skipped job inside a workflow reports success.
- A job that depends on other jobs must use an always-running condition when it
  is the required aggregate, otherwise upstream failures can skip the aggregate.
- Any required Actions check used with merge queue must run on `merge_group`.

## Current State

Current PR-related workflow names:

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: `CI`
  Runs on `pull_request`, `push` to `main`, and `merge_group`. Contains fast
  jobs plus conditional embedded Dolt jobs.
- `.github/workflows/regression.yml`: `Regression Tests`
  Runs on `pull_request`, `push` to `main`, and manual dispatch. Does not
  currently run on `merge_group`. Uses job-level conditional regression
  execution.
- `.github/workflows/cross-version-smoke.yml`: `Cross-Version Smoke Tests`
  Runs on every PR to `main`, tag pushes, and manual dispatch. Does not
  currently run on `merge_group`.
- `.github/workflows/nix-build.yml`: `nix build`
  Uses workflow-level `paths` filters on `pull_request` and `push`. This
  workflow must not be directly required.
- `.github/workflows/update-vendor-hash.yml`:
  `Update vendorHash for dependabot Go bumps`
  Runs on `pull_request_target` for Dependabot Go bumps. It mutates Dependabot
  branches and must not be a required PR check.

As of 2026-05-26, the live `gastownhall/beads` ruleset named
`Protect main - light (beads and gastown)` enforces deletion and non-fast-forward
protection on the default branch. It does not currently require status checks.

## Required Check Contract

After rollout, branch protection or the default-branch ruleset should require
exactly this GitHub Actions check:

- Required check name: `CI Gate / Required`
- Source: GitHub Actions
- Required on: pull requests and merge queue groups targeting `main`

Do not require these existing check names directly:

- `Detect CI tier`
- `Check build-tag policy`
- `Check cmd/bd pure-Go tests compile (CGO_ENABLED=0)`
- `Check version consistency`
- `Check doc flags freshness`
- `Check for .beads changes`
- `Test (ubuntu-latest)`
- `Test (macos-latest)`
- `Test (storage domain + uow)`
- `Build (Embedded Dolt)`
- `Test (Embedded Dolt Storage)`
- `Test (Embedded Dolt Cmd 1/20)` through `Test (Embedded Dolt Cmd 20/20)`
- `Test (Windows - smoke)`
- `Check formatting`
- `Lint`
- `Test Nix Flake`
- `Differential Regression (v0.49.6 baseline)`
- `Upgrade smoke (<version> -> candidate)`
- `Resolve versions to test`
- `nix build .#default`

Those checks should remain visible for diagnosis, but only the aggregate gate is
branch-protection required.

## Workflow Topology

### 1. Keep the Required Workflow Always Triggered

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` is the required workflow owner. Its trigger must stay
unfiltered:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
  merge_group:
```

Do not add `paths`, `paths-ignore`, or narrower branch filters to this workflow.
Path and risk decisions belong in detector jobs and job-level `if` conditions.

### 2. Add the Aggregate Gate Job

Add one final job to `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

```yaml
  ci-gate:
    name: CI Gate / Required
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs:
      - detect-ci-tier
      - check-build-tags
      - check-cmd-bd-puregeo-tests
      - check-version-consistency
      - check-doc-flags
      - check-no-beads-changes
      - test
      - test-domain-uow
      - build-embedded
      - test-embedded-storage
      - test-embedded-cmd
      - test-windows
      - fmt-check
      - lint
      - test-nix
    if: ${{ always() }}
    steps:
      - name: Evaluate CI gate
        env:
          FULL_EMBEDDED: ${{ needs.detect-ci-tier.outputs.full_embedded }}
          DETECT_CI_TIER: ${{ needs.detect-ci-tier.result }}
          CHECK_BUILD_TAGS: ${{ needs.check-build-tags.result }}
          CHECK_CMD_BD_PUREGEO_TESTS: ${{ needs.check-cmd-bd-puregeo-tests.result }}
          CHECK_VERSION_CONSISTENCY: ${{ needs.check-version-consistency.result }}
          CHECK_DOC_FLAGS: ${{ needs.check-doc-flags.result }}
          CHECK_NO_BEADS_CHANGES: ${{ needs.check-no-beads-changes.result }}
          TEST: ${{ needs.test.result }}
          TEST_DOMAIN_UOW: ${{ needs.test-domain-uow.result }}
          BUILD_EMBEDDED: ${{ needs.build-embedded.result }}
          TEST_EMBEDDED_STORAGE: ${{ needs.test-embedded-storage.result }}
          TEST_EMBEDDED_CMD: ${{ needs.test-embedded-cmd.result }}
          TEST_WINDOWS: ${{ needs.test-windows.result }}
          FMT_CHECK: ${{ needs.fmt-check.result }}
          LINT: ${{ needs.lint.result }}
          TEST_NIX: ${{ needs.test-nix.result }}
        run: bash .github/scripts/ci-gate.sh
```

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

Add `.github/scripts/ci-gate.sh` as a small shell evaluator. It should fail on
any `failure` or `cancelled` result. It should accept `skipped` only for jobs
that are intentionally absent for that event or risk tier:

- `CHECK_NO_BEADS_CHANGES=skipped` is acceptable on `push` and `merge_group`
  because the job is PR-only.
- `BUILD_EMBEDDED`, `TEST_EMBEDDED_STORAGE`, and `TEST_EMBEDDED_CMD` may be
  `skipped` only when `FULL_EMBEDDED != true`.
- All fast jobs must be `success`.

This keeps branch protection pointed at one job while preserving the underlying
job names and logs.

### 3. Keep Risk Decisions at Job Level

Conditional risk checks should use this pattern:

```yaml
  detect-risk:
    name: Detect risk
    outputs:
      run_risk: ${{ steps.detect.outputs.run_risk }}

  risk-check:
    name: Risk check
    needs: detect-risk
    if: needs.detect-risk.outputs.run_risk == 'true'

  ci-gate:
    name: CI Gate / Required
    needs: [detect-risk, risk-check]
    if: ${{ always() }}
```

The required aggregate should treat `risk-check=skipped` as success only when
`detect-risk.outputs.run_risk != true`. If the detector wanted the risk check
and the risk check is skipped, failed, or cancelled, the aggregate must fail.

Do not use this pattern for required checks:

```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - 'go.mod'
      - 'go.sum'
```

If that workflow or one of its jobs is made required, PRs that do not touch the
listed paths can be blocked waiting for a check that GitHub never creates.

## Conditional Check Placement

### Embedded Dolt Matrix

The current embedded Dolt topology already fits the required-check model:

- `detect-ci-tier` always runs.
- `build-embedded`, `test-embedded-storage`, and `test-embedded-cmd` use
  job-level `if`.
- `.github/scripts/ci-embedded-tier.sh` runs full embedded coverage for
  `push`, `merge_group`, unavailable PR diff bounds, and risky paths.
- Docs-only PRs can skip the embedded matrix without leaving the required gate
  pending, because the aggregate job still runs.

### Regression Tests

`Regression Tests` can stay visible as a non-required workflow. If regression
becomes branch-protection relevant, do not require
`Differential Regression (v0.49.6 baseline)` directly.

Use one of these narrow changes instead:

1. Move the regression detector and regression job into `ci.yml`, wire them into
   `CI Gate / Required`, and add `merge_group` behavior that defaults to running
   regression.
2. Keep `regression.yml` separate, remove any workflow-level skip filters, add
   `merge_group`, add a final `Regression Gate / Informational` aggregate, and
   leave it non-required unless branch protection is intentionally expanded.

The preferred required-check topology keeps only `CI Gate / Required` required.

### Nix Build

`.github/workflows/nix-build.yml` currently uses workflow-level `paths` filters.
Keep `nix build .#default` non-required.

If the full Nix build must affect mergeability, move it into `ci.yml` behind a
detector and job-level `if`, then teach `CI Gate / Required` when a skipped Nix
build is acceptable. Do not make the path-filtered `nix build` workflow or
`nix build .#default` job directly required.

### Cross-Version Smoke

`Cross-Version Smoke Tests` should remain non-required for ordinary PRs unless
maintainers explicitly choose to pay that cost in the aggregate gate. If it
becomes required, add `merge_group` and put it behind a detector plus aggregate
inside the required topology. Do not require matrix-expanded
`Upgrade smoke (<version> -> candidate)` jobs directly.

## Merge Queue Behavior

The required `CI Gate / Required` check must be reported for `merge_group`.
Otherwise, GitHub can enqueue a PR and then fail to merge because the required
check was never reported for the synthetic merge group commit.

Policy for `merge_group`:

- `CI` must include `merge_group`.
- `detect-ci-tier` should keep treating `merge_group` as full embedded coverage.
- Any risk detector added to the required topology should default to run on
  `merge_group`, because the merge group commit may combine individually safe
  PRs into a risky integration state.
- The aggregate gate should evaluate the merge group results exactly like PR
  results, except PR-only hygiene checks such as `Check for .beads changes` may
  be skipped by design.

## Rollout Steps

1. Add `.github/scripts/ci-gate.sh` and the `ci-gate` job to `ci.yml`.
2. Open a PR and verify the new check name appears exactly as
   `CI Gate / Required` from GitHub Actions.
3. Verify the gate succeeds on a docs-only PR where embedded jobs are skipped.
4. Verify the gate succeeds on a risky PR or manual test branch where embedded
   jobs run and pass.
5. Verify a deliberately failing underlying job makes `CI Gate / Required` fail.
6. Verify a merge queue run reports `CI Gate / Required` on the merge group.
7. Update the default-branch ruleset or branch protection to require only
   `CI Gate / Required` from GitHub Actions.
8. Remove any direct requirements for individual CI, regression, Nix, or
   cross-version job names.

## Rollback Steps

1. Remove `CI Gate / Required` from the default-branch ruleset or branch
   protection.
2. Restore the previous required check list if one existed.
3. Revert the workflow commit that added the aggregate gate job and evaluator.
4. Confirm a fresh PR no longer waits for `CI Gate / Required`.

If rollback is needed because the aggregate logic is wrong, prefer first
relaxing branch protection to remove the aggregate requirement. That unblocks
merges without hiding the failed workflow logs needed for diagnosis.

## Commit-Message Skip Directives

The topology above prevents pending required checks caused by path-filtered and
branch-filtered workflows. GitHub can still skip `push` and `pull_request`
workflows when the HEAD commit message contains skip directives such as
`[skip ci]`. If maintainers want a hard guarantee that commit-message skips
fail closed instead of pending, the required check must be emitted by a tiny
trusted reporter that is not itself skipped by those directives, for example a
`pull_request_target` workflow that does not check out or run PR code and
creates a check run named `CI Gate / Required` on the PR head SHA after
inspecting the untrusted `pull_request` workflow results.

That reporter is intentionally outside the narrow first rollout. Until then,
do not use commit-message skip directives on PRs targeting `main`.
