# Configuration System

bd has two complementary configuration systems:

1. **Tool-level configuration** (Viper): User preferences for tool behavior (flags, output format)
2. **Project-level configuration** (`bd config`): Integration data and project-specific settings

## Tool-Level Configuration (Viper)

### Overview

Tool preferences control how `bd` behaves globally or per-user. These are stored in config files or environment variables and managed by [Viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper).

**Configuration precedence** (highest to lowest):
1. Command-line flags (`--json`, `--dolt-auto-commit`, etc.)
2. Environment variables (`BD_JSON`, `BD_DOLT_AUTO_COMMIT`, etc.)
3. Config file (`~/.config/bd/config.yaml` or `.beads/config.yaml`)
4. Defaults

### Config File Locations

Viper searches for `config.yaml` in these locations (in order):
1. `.beads/config.yaml` - Project-specific tool settings (version-controlled)
2. `~/.config/bd/config.yaml` - User-specific tool settings
3. `~/.beads/config.yaml` - Legacy user settings

### Supported Settings

Tool-level settings you can configure:

| Setting | Flag | Environment Variable | Default | Description |
|---------|------|---------------------|---------|-------------|
| `json` | `--json` | `BD_JSON` | `false` | Output in JSON format |
| `no-push` | `--no-push` | `BD_NO_PUSH` | `false` | Skip pushing to remote in `bd dolt push` |
| `federation.remote` | - | `BD_FEDERATION_REMOTE` | (none) | Dolt remote URL for federation |
| `federation.sovereignty` | - | `BD_FEDERATION_SOVEREIGNTY` | (none) | Data sovereignty tier: `T1`, `T2`, `T3`, `T4` |
| `dolt.auto-commit` | `--dolt-auto-commit` | `BD_DOLT_AUTO_COMMIT` | `on` | (Dolt backend) Automatically create a Dolt commit after successful write commands |
| `create.require-description` | - | `BD_CREATE_REQUIRE_DESCRIPTION` | `false` | Require description when creating issues |
| `validation.on-create` | - | `BD_VALIDATION_ON_CREATE` | `none` | Template validation on create: `none`, `warn`, `error` |
| `validation.on-sync` | - | `BD_VALIDATION_ON_SYNC` | `none` | Template validation before sync: `none`, `warn`, `error` |
| `git.author` | - | `BD_GIT_AUTHOR` | (none) | Override commit author for beads commits |
| `git.no-gpg-sign` | - | `BD_GIT_NO_GPG_SIGN` | `false` | Disable GPG signing for beads commits |
| `directory.labels` | - | - | (none) | Map directories to labels for automatic filtering |
| `external_projects` | - | - | (none) | Map project names to paths for cross-project deps |
| `backup.enabled` | - | `BD_BACKUP_ENABLED` | `false` | Enable periodic Dolt-native backup to `.beads/backup/` |
| `backup.interval` | - | `BD_BACKUP_INTERVAL` | `15m` | Minimum time between auto-backups |
| `dolt.auto-push` | - | `BD_DOLT_AUTO_PUSH` | `false` | Auto-push to Dolt remote after writes (explicit opt-in) |
| `dolt.auto-push-interval` | - | `BD_DOLT_AUTO_PUSH_INTERVAL` | `5m` | Minimum time between auto-pushes |
| `dolt.shared-server` | `--shared-server` | `BEADS_DOLT_SHARED_SERVER` | `false` | Share a single Dolt server across all projects at `~/.beads/shared-server/` |
| `dolt.idle-timeout` | - | - | `30m` | Idle auto-stop timeout (`"0"` disables) |
| `db` | `--db` | `BD_DB` | (auto-discover) | Database path |
| `actor` | `--actor` | `BEADS_ACTOR` | `git config user.name` | Actor name for audit trail (see below) |

**Backend note:** Dolt is the only storage backend. By default, Dolt runs in embedded mode (in-process, no server). Use `bd init --server` or `BEADS_DOLT_SERVER_MODE=1` for server mode. See [DOLT.md](DOLT.md) for details.

### Dolt Auto-Commit (SQL commit vs Dolt commit)

When using the **Dolt backend**, there are two different kinds of “commit”:

- **SQL transaction commit**: what happens when a `bd` command updates tables successfully (durable in the Dolt *working set*).
- **Dolt version-control commit**: what records those changes into Dolt’s *history* (visible in `bd vc log`, push/pull/merge workflows).

By default, `bd` is configured to **auto-commit Dolt history after each successful write command**:

- **Default**: `dolt.auto-commit: on`
- **Disable for a single command**:

```bash
bd --dolt-auto-commit off create "No commit for this one"
```

- **Disable in config** (`.beads/config.yaml` or `~/.config/bd/config.yaml`):

```yaml
dolt:
  auto-commit: off
```

**Caveat:** enabling this creates **more Dolt commits** over time (one per write command). This is intentional so changes are not left only in the working set.

### Auto-Backup

Periodic Dolt-native backup to `.beads/backup/` provides an off-machine recovery path. Local Dolt snapshots (via `dolt.auto-commit`) remain the primary safety net; backup is a secondary layer.

```yaml
backup:
  enabled: true    # Enable auto-backup after write commands
  interval: 15m    # Minimum time between auto-backups
```

**How it works:**
- After each write command (in PersistentPostRun), `bd` checks the Dolt HEAD commit hash against the last backup state
- If data changed and the throttle interval has passed, a Dolt-native backup is synced to `.beads/backup/`
- Full commit history is preserved in the backup
- State is tracked in `.beads/backup/backup_state.json`

**Manual commands:**
- `bd backup init <path>` — register a backup destination (filesystem or DoltHub URL)
- `bd backup sync` — push to the configured backup destination
- `bd backup restore [path]` — restore from a backup (`--force` to overwrite)
- `bd backup remove` — unregister the backup destination
- `bd backup status` — show backup configuration and last sync time

### Dolt Auto-Push

By default, `bd` does not push automatically after write commands. Auto-push is explicit opt-in because concurrent pushes to git-protocol Dolt remotes can corrupt or strand remote history when multiple writers race.

```yaml
dolt:
  auto-push: false      # Explicit opt-in only; set true for single-writer setups
  auto-push-interval: 5m  # Minimum time between auto-pushes
```

**How it works:**
- After each write command (in PersistentPostRun, after auto-commit and auto-backup), `bd` checks whether a push is due
- Pushes are debounced: skipped if the last push was less than `dolt.auto-push-interval` ago
- Change detection: skipped if the Dolt HEAD commit hasn't changed since last push
- Push failures are warnings only (non-fatal)
- Last push time and commit are tracked in the metadata table

**Opt in:**
```yaml
dolt:
  auto-push: true
```

### Actor Identity Resolution

The actor name (used for `created_by` in issues and audit trails) is resolved in this order:

1. `--actor` flag (explicit override)
2. `BEADS_ACTOR` environment variable
3. `BD_ACTOR` environment variable (deprecated alias, kept for backwards compatibility)
4. `git config user.name`
5. `$USER` environment variable (system username fallback)
6. `"unknown"` (final fallback)

For most developers, no configuration is needed - beads will use your git identity automatically. This ensures your issue authorship matches your commit authorship.

To override, set `BEADS_ACTOR` in your shell profile:
```bash
export BEADS_ACTOR="my-github-handle"
```

### Sync Mode Configuration

The sync mode controls how beads synchronizes data with git and/or Dolt remotes.

#### Sync Mode

Beads uses `dolt-native` sync mode exclusively. Dolt remotes handle sync directly with cell-level merge. Use `bd export` for issue portability, and `bd backup init` / `bd backup sync` / `bd backup restore` for Dolt-native backups.

#### Federation Configuration

- `federation.remote`: Dolt remote URL (e.g., `dolthub://org/beads`, `gs://bucket/beads`, `s3://bucket/beads`, `az://account.blob.core.windows.net/container/beads`)
- `federation.sovereignty`: Data sovereignty tier:
  - `T1`: Full sovereignty - data never leaves controlled infrastructure
  - `T2`: Regional sovereignty - data stays within region/jurisdiction
  - `T3`: Provider sovereignty - data with trusted cloud provider
  - `T4`: No restrictions - data can be anywhere

#### Example Configuration

```yaml
# .beads/config.yaml
# Optional: Dolt federation
federation:
  remote: dolthub://myorg/beads
  sovereignty: T2
```

### Example Config File

`~/.config/bd/config.yaml`:
```yaml
# Default to JSON output for scripting
json: true

# Dolt auto-commit (creates Dolt history commit after each write)
dolt:
  auto-commit: on
```

`.beads/config.yaml` (project-specific):
```yaml
# Require descriptions on all issues (enforces context for future work)
create:
  require-description: true

# Template validation settings (bd-t7jq)
# Validates that issues include required sections based on issue type
# Values: none (default), warn (print warning), error (block operation)
validation:
  on-create: warn   # Warn when creating issues missing sections
  on-sync: none     # No validation on sync (backwards compatible)

# Git commit signing options (GH#600)
# Useful when you have Touch ID commit signing that prompts for each commit
git:
  author: "beads-bot <beads@example.com>"  # Override commit author
  no-gpg-sign: true                         # Disable GPG signing

# Directory-aware label scoping for monorepos (GH#541)
# When running bd ready/list from a matching directory, issues with
# that label are automatically shown (as if --label-any was passed)
directory:
  labels:
    packages/maverick: maverick
    packages/agency: agency
    packages/io: io

# Feedback title formatting for mutating commands (GH#1384)
# 0 = hide titles, N > 0 = truncate to N characters
output:
  title-length: 255

# Cross-project dependency resolution (bd-h807)
# Maps project names to paths for resolving external: blocked_by references
# Paths can be relative (from cwd) or absolute
external_projects:
  beads: ../beads
  other-project: /path/to/other-project
```

### Why Two Systems?

**Tool settings (Viper)** are user preferences:
- How should I see output? (`--json`)
- Should Dolt auto-commit? (`--dolt-auto-commit`)
- How should the CLI behave?

**Project config (`bd config`)** is project data:
- What's our Jira URL?
- What are our Linear tokens?
- How do we map statuses?

This separation is correct: **tool settings are user-specific, project config is team-shared**.

Agents benefit from `bd config`'s structured CLI interface over manual YAML editing.

## Project-Level Configuration (`bd config`)

### Overview

Project configuration is:
- **Per-project**: Isolated to each `.beads/` database
- **Version-control-friendly**: Stored in the database, queryable and scriptable
- **Machine-readable**: JSON output for automation
- **Namespace-based**: Organized by integration or purpose

## Commands

### Set Configuration

```bash
bd config set <key> <value>
bd config set --json <key> <value>  # JSON output
```

Examples:
```bash
bd config set jira.url "https://company.atlassian.net"
bd config set jira.project "PROJ"
bd config set jira.status_map.todo "open"
```

### Get Configuration

```bash
bd config get <key>
bd config get --json <key>  # JSON output
```

Examples:
```bash
bd config get jira.url
# Output: https://company.atlassian.net

bd config get --json jira.url
# Output: {"key":"jira.url","value":"https://company.atlassian.net"}
```

### List All Configuration

```bash
bd config list
bd config list --json  # JSON output
```

Example output:
```
Configuration:
  compact_tier1_days = 90
  compact_tier1_dep_levels = 2
  jira.project = PROJ
  jira.url = https://company.atlassian.net
```

JSON output:
```json
{
  "compact_tier1_days": "90",
  "compact_tier1_dep_levels": "2",
  "jira.project": "PROJ",
  "jira.url": "https://company.atlassian.net"
}
```

### Unset Configuration

```bash
bd config unset <key>
bd config unset --json <key>  # JSON output
```

Example:
```bash
bd config unset jira.url
```

## Namespace Convention

Configuration keys use dot-notation namespaces to organize settings:

### Core Namespaces

- `compact_*` - Compaction settings (used by `bd admin compact`)
- `issue_prefix` - Issue ID prefix (managed by `bd init`)
- `issue_id_mode` - ID generation mode: `hash` (default) or `counter` (sequential integers)
- `max_collision_prob` - Maximum collision probability for adaptive hash IDs (default: 0.25)
- `min_hash_length` - Minimum hash ID length (default: 4)
- `max_hash_length` - Maximum hash ID length (default: 8)
- `import.orphan_handling` - How to handle hierarchical issues with missing parents during import (default: `allow`)
- `export.auto` - Refresh the git-tracked JSONL file after every write command (default: `true`)
- `export.path` - Output filename relative to `.beads/` (default: `issues.jsonl`)
- `export.interval` - Minimum time between auto-exports (default: `60s`)
- `export.git-add` - Run `git add` on the export file after writing (default: `true`)
- `export.error_policy` - Error handling strategy for exports (default: `strict`)
- `export.retry_attempts` - Number of retry attempts for transient errors (default: 3)
- `export.retry_backoff_ms` - Initial backoff in milliseconds for retries (default: 100)
- `export.skip_encoding_errors` - Skip issues that fail JSON encoding (default: false)
- `export.write_manifest` - Write .manifest.json with export metadata (default: false)
- `auto_export.error_policy` - Override error policy for auto-exports (default: `best-effort`)
- `sync.branch` - Name of the dedicated sync branch for beads data (see docs/PROTECTED_BRANCHES.md)
- `sync.require_confirmation_on_mass_delete` - Require interactive confirmation before pushing when >50% of issues vanish during a merge AND more than 5 issues existed before (default: `false`)

### Integration Namespaces

Use these namespaces for external integrations:

- `jira.*` - Jira integration settings
- `linear.*` - Linear integration settings
- `github.*` - GitHub integration settings
- `ado.*` - Azure DevOps integration settings
- `custom.*` - Custom integration settings

### Status and Type Customization

- `status.custom` - Custom issue statuses with optional categories (comma-separated)
- `types.custom` - Custom issue types (comma-separated)

**Custom statuses** support category annotations that control behavior:

```bash
# Format: name:category (category is optional)
bd config set status.custom "in_review:active,qa_testing:wip,on_hold:frozen,archived:done"

# Categories: active, wip, done, frozen
# - active: shows in bd ready, included in default bd list
# - wip: excluded from bd ready, included in default bd list
# - done: excluded from bd ready AND default bd list (terminal)
# - frozen: excluded from bd ready AND default bd list (on hold)
# - (none): excluded from bd ready, included in default bd list (backward compatible)
```

**Custom types:**

```bash
bd config set types.custom "agent,molecule,event"
```

See `bd statuses` and `bd types` commands to list all configured statuses and types.

### Example: Sequential Counter IDs (issue_id_mode=counter)

By default, beads generates hash-based IDs (e.g., `bd-a3f2`, `bd-7f3a8`). For projects that prefer
short sequential IDs (e.g., `bd-1`, `bd-2`, `bd-3`), enable counter mode:

```bash
bd config set issue_id_mode counter
```

**Valid values:**

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `hash` | (default) Hash-based IDs, adaptive length, collision-safe |
| `counter` | Sequential integers per prefix: `bd-1`, `bd-2`, `bd-3`, ... |

**Counter mode behavior:**
- Each prefix (`bd`, `plug`, etc.) has its own independent counter
- Counter is stored atomically in the database; concurrent creates within a single Dolt session are safe
- Explicit `--id` flag always overrides counter mode (the counter is not incremented)

**Enabling counter mode:**

```bash
bd config set issue_id_mode counter

# Now new issues get sequential IDs
bd create "First issue" -p 1
# → bd-1

bd create "Second issue" -p 2
# → bd-2
```

**Migration warning:** If you switch an existing repository to counter mode, seed the counter
to avoid collisions with existing IDs. Find your highest current integer ID and set the counter
accordingly:

```bash
# Check your highest existing sequential ID (if any)
bd list --json | jq -r '.[].id' | grep -E '^bd-[0-9]+$' | sort -t- -k2 -n | tail -1

# Seed the counter (e.g., if highest existing ID is bd-42)
bd config set issue_id_mode counter
# The counter auto-initializes at 0; new issues start at 1
# If you already have bd-1 through bd-42, manually set counter:
# (no direct CLI for seeding — use bd dolt sql or create/delete N issues)
```

For fresh repositories switching to counter mode before any issues exist, no seeding is needed.

**Per-prefix counter isolation:**

Each issue prefix maintains its own counter independently. In multi-repo or routed setups,
`bd-*` issues and `plug-*` issues each start at 1:

```bash
# Prefix "bd" and prefix "plug" have independent counters
bd create "Core task" -p 1          # → bd-1
bd create "Plugin task" -p 1        # → plug-1 (if prefix is "plug")
```

**Tradeoff — hash vs. counter:**

| | Hash IDs | Counter IDs |
|---|---|---|
| Human readability | Lower (e.g., `bd-a3f2`) | Higher (e.g., `bd-1`) |
| Distributed/concurrent safety | Excellent (collision-free across branches) | Needs care (counters can diverge on parallel branches) |
| Predictability | Unpredictable | Sequential |
| Best for | Multi-agent, multi-branch workflows | Single-writer or project-management UIs |

Counter IDs are well-suited for linear project-management workflows and human-facing issue tracking.
Hash IDs are safer when multiple agents or branches create issues concurrently, since each hash is
independently unique without coordination.

See [ADAPTIVE_IDS.md](ADAPTIVE_IDS.md) for full documentation on hash-based ID generation.

### Example: Adaptive Hash ID Configuration

```bash
# Configure adaptive ID lengths (see docs/ADAPTIVE_IDS.md)
# Default: 25% max collision probability
bd config set max_collision_prob "0.25"

# Start with 4-char IDs, scale up as database grows
bd config set min_hash_length "4"
bd config set max_hash_length "8"

# Stricter collision tolerance (1%)
bd config set max_collision_prob "0.01"

# Force minimum 5-char IDs for consistency
bd config set min_hash_length "5"
```

See [ADAPTIVE_IDS.md](ADAPTIVE_IDS.md) for detailed documentation.

### Example: Export Error Handling

Controls how export operations handle errors when fetching issue data (labels, comments, dependencies).

```bash
# Strict: Fail fast on any error (default for user-initiated exports)
bd config set export.error_policy "strict"

# Best-effort: Skip failed operations with warnings (good for auto-export)
bd config set export.error_policy "best-effort"

# Partial: Retry transient failures, skip persistent ones with manifest
bd config set export.error_policy "partial"
bd config set export.write_manifest "true"

# Required-core: Fail on core data (issues/deps), skip enrichments (labels/comments)
bd config set export.error_policy "required-core"

# Customize retry behavior
bd config set export.retry_attempts "5"
bd config set export.retry_backoff_ms "200"

# Skip individual issues that fail JSON encoding
bd config set export.skip_encoding_errors "true"

# Auto-export uses different policy (background operation)
bd config set auto_export.error_policy "best-effort"
```

**Policy details:**

- **`strict`** (default) - Fail immediately on any error. Ensures complete exports but may block on transient issues like database locks. Best for critical exports and migrations.

- **`best-effort`** - Skip failed batches with warnings. Continues export even if labels or comments fail to load. Best for auto-exports and background sync where availability matters more than completeness.

- **`partial`** - Retry transient failures (3x by default), then skip with manifest file. Creates `.manifest.json` alongside JSONL documenting what succeeded/failed. Best for large databases with occasional corruption.

- **`required-core`** - Fail on core data (issues, dependencies), skip enrichments (labels, comments) with warnings. Best when metadata is secondary to issue tracking.

**When to use each mode:**

- Use `strict` (default) for production backups and critical exports
- Use `best-effort` for auto-exports (default via `auto_export.error_policy`)
- Use `partial` when you need visibility into export completeness
- Use `required-core` when labels/comments are optional

**Context-specific behavior:**

User-initiated exports (`bd dolt push`, manual export commands) use `export.error_policy` (default: `strict`).

Auto-exports (git hook sync) use `auto_export.error_policy` (default: `best-effort`), falling back to `export.error_policy` if not set.

**Example: Different policies for different contexts:**

```bash
# Critical project: strict everywhere
bd config set export.error_policy "strict"

# Development project: strict user exports, permissive auto-exports
bd config set export.error_policy "strict"
bd config set auto_export.error_policy "best-effort"

# Large database with occasional corruption
bd config set export.error_policy "partial"
bd config set export.write_manifest "true"
bd config set export.retry_attempts "5"
```

### Example: Import Orphan Handling

Controls how imports handle hierarchical child issues when their parent is missing from the database:

```bash
# Strictest: Fail import if parent is missing (safest, prevents orphans)
bd config set import.orphan_handling "strict"

# Auto-resurrect: Search JSONL history and recreate missing parents as tombstones
bd config set import.orphan_handling "resurrect"

# Skip: Skip orphaned issues with warning (partial import)
bd config set import.orphan_handling "skip"

# Allow: Import orphans without validation (default, most permissive)
bd config set import.orphan_handling "allow"
```

**Mode details:**

- **`strict`** - Fails immediately if a child's parent is missing. Use when database integrity is critical.
- **`resurrect`** - Searches for missing parents and recreates them as tombstones (Status=Closed, Priority=4). Preserves hierarchy with minimal data. Dependencies are also resurrected on best-effort basis.
- **`skip`** - Skips orphaned children with a warning. Partial import succeeds but some issues are excluded.
- **`allow`** - Imports orphans without parent validation. Most permissive. **This is the default** because it ensures all data is imported even if hierarchy is temporarily broken.

These modes apply when bootstrapping a database with `bd init --from-jsonl` or when `bd dolt pull` merges remote data:

```bash
# Override config for a single pull
bd config set import.orphan_handling "resurrect"
bd dolt pull  # Respects import.orphan_handling setting
```

**When to use each mode:**

- Use `allow` (default) for daily sync - ensures no data loss
- Use `resurrect` when pulling from remotes that had parent deletions
- Use `strict` only when you need to guarantee parent existence
- Use `skip` rarely - only when you want to selectively import a subset

### Example: Sync Safety Options

Controls for the sync branch workflow (see docs/PROTECTED_BRANCHES.md):

```bash
# Configure sync branch (required for protected branch workflow)
bd config set sync.branch beads-sync

# Enable mass deletion protection (optional, default: false)
# When enabled, if >50% of issues vanish during a merge AND more than 5
# issues existed before the merge, bd dolt push will:
# 1. Show forensic info about vanished issues
# 2. Prompt for confirmation before pushing
bd config set sync.require_confirmation_on_mass_delete "true"
```

**When to enable `sync.require_confirmation_on_mass_delete`:**

- Multi-user workflows where accidental mass deletions could propagate
- Critical projects where data loss prevention is paramount
- When you want manual review before pushing large changes

**When to keep it disabled (default):**

- Single-user workflows where you trust your local changes
- CI/CD pipelines that need non-interactive sync
- When you want hands-free automation

### Example: Jira Integration

```bash
# Configure Jira connection
bd config set jira.url "https://company.atlassian.net"
bd config set jira.project "PROJ"
bd config set jira.projects "PROJ1,PROJ2"   # Multiple projects (comma-separated)
bd config set jira.api_token "YOUR_TOKEN"

# Map bd statuses to Jira statuses
bd config set jira.status_map.open "To Do"
bd config set jira.status_map.in_progress "In Progress"
bd config set jira.status_map.closed "Done"

# Map bd issue types to Jira issue types
bd config set jira.type_map.bug "Bug"
bd config set jira.type_map.feature "Story"
bd config set jira.type_map.task "Task"
```

### Example: Linear Integration

Linear integration provides bidirectional sync between bd and Linear via GraphQL API.

**Required configuration:**

```bash
# API Key (recommended: use environment variable to avoid git exposure)
export LINEAR_API_KEY="lin_api_YOUR_API_KEY"  # add to ~/.secrets or ~/.zshrc

# Team ID (find in Linear team settings or URL)
bd config set linear.team_id "team-uuid-here"

# Multiple team IDs (comma-separated; can also use LINEAR_TEAM_IDS env var)
bd config set linear.team_ids "uuid-team-1,uuid-team-2"
```

When `linear.team_ids` is set, `bd linear sync` fetches issues from all listed
teams. For push operations with multiple teams, use the `--team` flag to specify
the target. The singular `linear.team_id` is still supported for backward
compatibility.

**Getting your Linear credentials:**

1. **API Key**: Go to Linear → Settings → API → Personal API keys → Create key
2. **Team ID**: Go to Linear → Settings → General → Team ID (or extract from URLs)

**Priority mapping (Linear 0-4 → Beads 0-4):**

Linear and Beads both use 0-4 priority scales, but with different semantics:
- Linear: 0=no priority, 1=urgent, 2=high, 3=medium, 4=low
- Beads: 0=critical, 1=high, 2=medium, 3=low, 4=backlog

Default mapping (configurable):

```bash
bd config set linear.priority_map.0 4    # No priority -> Backlog
bd config set linear.priority_map.1 0    # Urgent -> Critical
bd config set linear.priority_map.2 1    # High -> High
bd config set linear.priority_map.3 2    # Medium -> Medium
bd config set linear.priority_map.4 3    # Low -> Low
```

**State mapping (Linear state types → Beads statuses):**

Map Linear workflow state types to Beads statuses:

```bash
bd config set linear.state_map.backlog open
bd config set linear.state_map.unstarted open
bd config set linear.state_map.started in_progress
bd config set linear.state_map.completed closed
bd config set linear.state_map.canceled closed

# For custom workflow states, use lowercase state name:
bd config set linear.state_map.in_review in_progress
bd config set linear.state_map.blocked blocked
bd config set linear.state_map.on_hold blocked
```

**Label to issue type mapping:**

Infer bd issue type from Linear labels:

```bash
bd config set linear.label_type_map.bug bug
bd config set linear.label_type_map.defect bug
bd config set linear.label_type_map.feature feature
bd config set linear.label_type_map.enhancement feature
bd config set linear.label_type_map.epic epic
bd config set linear.label_type_map.chore chore
bd config set linear.label_type_map.maintenance chore
bd config set linear.label_type_map.task task
```

**Relation type mapping (Linear relations → Beads dependencies):**

```bash
bd config set linear.relation_map.blocks blocks
bd config set linear.relation_map.blockedBy blocks
bd config set linear.relation_map.duplicate duplicates
bd config set linear.relation_map.related related
```

Relation import is opt-in when pulling:

```bash
bd linear sync --pull --relations
```

**Sync commands:**

```bash
# Bidirectional sync (pull then push, with conflict resolution)
bd linear sync

# Pull only (import from Linear)
bd linear sync --pull

# Pull only if data is stale (skip if fresh)
bd linear sync --pull-if-stale

# Pull with custom staleness threshold (default 20m)
bd linear sync --pull-if-stale --threshold 5m

# Pull issues and Linear relations as bd dependencies
bd linear sync --pull --relations

# Pull and rebuild Linear project milestones as local epic parents
bd linear sync --pull --milestones

# Push only (export to Linear)
bd linear sync --push

# Dry run (preview without changes)
bd linear sync --dry-run

# Conflict resolution options
bd linear sync --prefer-local    # Local version wins on conflicts
bd linear sync --prefer-linear   # Linear version wins on conflicts
# Default: newer timestamp wins

# Check sync status
bd linear status
```

**Staleness detection:**

After each successful pull, `bd` writes the current timestamp to `.beads/last_pull`. This enables ambient staleness detection:

- **`--pull-if-stale`**: Only pull if data is older than the threshold (default 20m). When data is fresh, prints "Linear data is fresh" and exits. In `--json` mode, includes `"is_fresh": true/false`.
- **`--threshold`**: Override the default 20-minute staleness threshold (e.g., `--threshold 5m`).
- **Debounce**: A 5-minute debounce prevents agent loops — if a pull completed within the last 5 minutes, data is always treated as fresh regardless of the threshold.
- **`bd prime` auto-pull**: When `LINEAR_API_KEY` is set and data is stale, `bd prime` automatically pulls from Linear before emitting orientation output.
- **Per-session warning**: On any `bd` command, if data is stale, a one-time warning is emitted to stderr: `⚠ Linear data is 45m stale — run 'bd linear sync --pull' to refresh`. Suppressed in subsequent commands within the same shell session.

**Automatic sync tracking:**

The `linear.last_sync` config key is automatically updated after each sync, enabling incremental sync (only fetch issues updated since last sync).

### Example: GitHub Integration

```bash
# Configure GitHub connection
bd config set github.org "myorg"
bd config set github.repo "myrepo"
bd config set github.token "YOUR_TOKEN"

# Map bd labels to GitHub labels
bd config set github.label_map.bug "bug"
bd config set github.label_map.feature "enhancement"
```

### Example: Azure DevOps (ADO) Integration

Azure DevOps integration provides bidirectional sync between bd and ADO work items.

**Required configuration:**

```bash
# Personal access token (can also use AZURE_DEVOPS_PAT environment variable)
bd config set ado.pat "YOUR_PAT"

# Organization name (can also use AZURE_DEVOPS_ORG environment variable)
bd config set ado.org "myorg"

# Project name (can also use AZURE_DEVOPS_PROJECT environment variable)
bd config set ado.project "MyProject"

# Multiple projects (comma-separated; can also use AZURE_DEVOPS_PROJECTS env var)
bd config set ado.projects "Project1,Project2"
```

When `ado.projects` is set, `bd ado sync` fetches work items from all listed
projects in a single WIQL query. The singular `ado.project` is still supported
for backward compatibility.

**Optional configuration:**

```bash
# Custom base URL for Azure DevOps Server (on-prem) instances
# (can also use AZURE_DEVOPS_URL environment variable)
# When set, ado.org is not required — the URL replaces the default dev.azure.com base.
bd config set ado.url "https://ado.internal.example.com/DefaultCollection"
```

**Getting your Azure DevOps PAT:**

1. Go to Azure DevOps → User Settings (top-right icon) → Personal access tokens
2. Click "New Token"
3. Select the organization and set an expiration
4. Grant **Work Items: Read & Write** scope (minimum for sync)
5. Copy the token — it is only shown once

**State mapping (ADO Agile template defaults → Beads statuses):**

ADO uses process-template-specific states (Agile, Scrum, CMMI). The defaults
use the Agile template. Override with `ado.state_map.*` for your process:

```bash
# Default Agile mapping (built-in, no config needed):
#   New      → open
#   Active   → in_progress
#   Resolved → closed
#   Closed   → closed
#   Removed  → deferred

# Override for Scrum template:
bd config set ado.state_map.open "New"
bd config set ado.state_map.in_progress "Committed"
bd config set ado.state_map.blocked "Committed"
bd config set ado.state_map.deferred "Removed"
bd config set ado.state_map.closed "Done"
```

**Type mapping (ADO work item types ↔ Beads issue types):**

```bash
# Default mapping (built-in, no config needed):
#   Bug               → bug
#   User Story        → feature
#   Product Backlog Item → feature
#   Task              → task
#   Epic              → epic

# Override for your process template:
bd config set ado.type_map.bug "Bug"
bd config set ado.type_map.feature "Feature"
bd config set ado.type_map.task "Task"
bd config set ado.type_map.epic "Epic"
bd config set ado.type_map.chore "Task"
```

**Priority mapping (ADO 1-4 → Beads 0-4):**

ADO uses a 1-4 scale; Beads uses 0-4. The mapping is:
- ADO 1 (Critical) → Beads 0 (Critical)
- ADO 2 (High) → Beads 1 (High)
- ADO 3 (Medium) → Beads 2 (Medium)
- ADO 4 (Low) → Beads 3 (Low)
- Beads 4 (Backlog) → ADO 4 (lossy: backlog collapses to low)

Priority mapping is not configurable — it is handled automatically.

**Environment variables:**

All ADO config keys have environment variable equivalents:

| Config Key     | Environment Variable     |
|----------------|--------------------------|
| `ado.pat`      | `AZURE_DEVOPS_PAT`       |
| `ado.org`      | `AZURE_DEVOPS_ORG`       |
| `ado.project`  | `AZURE_DEVOPS_PROJECT`   |
| `ado.projects` | `AZURE_DEVOPS_PROJECTS`  |
| `ado.url`      | `AZURE_DEVOPS_URL`       |

Environment variables take effect when the corresponding `bd config` key is not set.

**Sync commands:**

```bash
# Bidirectional sync (pull then push, with conflict resolution)
bd ado sync

# Pull only (import from Azure DevOps)
bd ado sync --pull-only

# Push only (export to Azure DevOps)
bd ado sync --push-only

# Dry run (preview without changes)
bd ado sync --dry-run

# Conflict resolution options
bd ado sync --prefer-local    # Local version wins on conflicts
bd ado sync --prefer-ado      # Azure DevOps version wins on conflicts
bd ado sync --prefer-newer    # Most recent version wins (default)

# Check sync status and configuration
bd ado status

# List accessible projects (useful for finding your project name)
bd ado projects --json
```

**Automatic sync tracking:**

The `ado.last_sync` config key is automatically updated after each sync, enabling incremental sync (only fetch work items updated since last sync).

## Use in Scripts

Configuration is designed for scripting. Use `--json` for machine-readable output:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Get Jira URL
JIRA_URL=$(bd config get --json jira.url | jq -r '.value')

# Get all config and extract multiple values
bd config list --json | jq -r '.["jira.project"]'
```

Example Python script:
```python
import json
import subprocess

def get_config(key):
    result = subprocess.run(
        ["bd", "config", "get", "--json", key],
        capture_output=True,
        text=True
    )
    data = json.loads(result.stdout)
    return data["value"]

def list_config():
    result = subprocess.run(
        ["bd", "config", "list", "--json"],
        capture_output=True,
        text=True
    )
    return json.loads(result.stdout)

# Use in integration
jira_url = get_config("jira.url")
jira_project = get_config("jira.project")
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use namespaces**: Prefix keys with integration name (e.g., `jira.*`, `linear.*`)
2. **Hierarchical keys**: Use dots for structure (e.g., `jira.status_map.open`)
3. **Document your keys**: Add comments in integration scripts
4. **Security**: Store tokens in config, but ensure `.beads/dolt/` and `.beads/*.db` are in `.gitignore` (bd does this automatically)
5. **Per-project**: Configuration is project-specific, so each repo can have different settings

## Integration with bd Commands

Some bd commands automatically use configuration:

- `bd admin compact` uses `compact_tier1_days`, `compact_tier1_dep_levels`, etc.
- `bd init` sets `issue_prefix`

External integration scripts can read configuration to sync with Jira, Linear, GitHub, etc.
