# Beads Release - Gateway to the Release Molecule
# =============================================================================
#
# WHY A MOLECULE INSTEAD OF A SCRIPT?
#
# Gas Town uses molecules (not scripts) for multi-step workflows because:
#
#   1. LEDGER: Each step is a timestamped entry in your work history.
#      Your CV accumulates from completed work. Batch scripts are invisible.
#
#   2. RESUMABILITY: If a release fails at step 17, you resume at step 17.
#      Scripts restart from scratch or require manual state tracking.
#
#   3. OBSERVABILITY: `bd activity --follow` shows real-time progress.
#      Scripts are opaque until they finish (or fail).
#
#   4. GATES: The release molecule waits for CI via gates, not polling.
#      Clean phase handoffs without busy-waiting.

#
# THE RELEASE MOLECULE
#
# The `beads-release` formula has 29 steps across 3 phases:
#   Phase 1: Preflight → version bumps → git push (polecat work)
#   Gate:    Await CI completion (async, no polling)
#   Phase 2: Verify GitHub/npm/PyPI releases (parallel)
#   Phase 3: Local install → daemon restart
#
# View the full formula:
#   bd formula show beads-release
#
# =============================================================================
#
# ⚠️  CRITICAL: GITHUB API RATE LIMIT WARNING ⚠️
#
# The GitHub API allows 5000 requests/hour. Multiple past releases have burned
# through the ENTIRE rate limit by polling CI status in loops, blocking ALL
# crew members for up to an hour.
#
# DO NOT:
#   - Use `gh run watch` (polls every 3s = 1200 req/hr per invocation)
#   - Run background monitors that poll CI status
#   - Loop on `gh run view` or `gh run list`
#
# INSTEAD:
#   - Let the molecule gate system handle CI waiting
#   - If checking manually: sleep 10-15min, then check ONCE
#   - Budget: 3-5 total API calls for CI monitoring
#

usage() {
    cat << 'EOF'
Usage: release.sh <version> [--dry-run]

Creates a release molecule (wisp) for the specified version.

Arguments:
  version    Version number (e.g., 0.50.0)
  --dry-run  Show what would happen without creating the molecule

This script is a GATEWAY to the beads-release molecule, not a replacement.
It creates the wisp and shows you how to execute it.

Examples:
  ./scripts/release.sh 0.50.0           # Create release molecule
  ./scripts/release.sh 0.50.0 --dry-run # Preview only

After running this script:
  1. The release molecule (wisp) is created with all 29 steps
  2. Hook it to start working: gt hook <mol-id>
  3. Or sling to a polecat: gt sling beads/polecats/p1 <mol-id>
  4. Watch progress: bd activity --follow
