#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Release-target cross-compilation gate (bazel.yml's pure-Go lane): build
# every non-test Go target of the module for every GOOS/GOARCH row of
# scripts/ci/release-targets.txt, the Bazel form of
# `CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=<os> GOARCH=<arch> go build -tags gms_pure_go ./...`.
#
# One `bazel build` of //tools/bazel:release_cross with
# --//tools/bazel:release_platforms set to every manifest row: its split
# transition builds every listed target once per platform with cgo off (and
# the gms_pure_go tag every build carries), all platforms in parallel on the
# remote workers. --keep_going reports every broken target of every
# platform in one run, and a failed run names each failing platform. The target list is every go_library and go_binary
# (the packages `go build ./...` compiles; go_test targets are `go test`'s),
# kept by tools/bazel/go_srcs.py (`make bazel-sync`) minus the ones tagged
# cgo-only (incompatible with //tools/bazel:pure), which `go build ./...` skips
# under CGO_ENABLED=0. Before building, the list is checked against `bazel
# query`, so a target the generator missed fails here instead of going
# uncompiled. The list also holds //tools/bazel:pure_bd_has_no_cgo_only_deps:
# Bazel compiles gozstd's pure stubs (third_party/patches/
# gozstd_nocgo.patch) where `go build` rejects a CGO_ENABLED=0 import of it,
# so that check fails a platform whose pure bd links gozstd.
#
# Coverage boundary, as in the `go build` job this replaces: every target
# builds with cgo off, but .goreleaser.yml builds linux/amd64, linux/arm64
# and windows/amd64 with CGO_ENABLED=1, and release.yml builds the darwin
# pair natively with CGO_ENABLED=1, so the cgo half of the tree (beads_cgo.go
# -> internal/storage/embeddeddolt) is compiled for none of them here.
#
# Usage: bazel-release-cross-compile.sh [extra bazel build flags...]
