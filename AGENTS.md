# Beads — Contributor Agent Instructions

This file is for agents and humans **developing beads** (`bd`). If you are
using `bd` to track work in your own project, read the user docs instead:
[docs site](https://beads.gascity.com/) and
[IDE and agent setup](docs/getting-started/ide-setup.md).

<!-- Contributor-only file. Do not run `bd setup` or `bd init` against this
checkout: they would inject the end-user beads integration block here. -->

Nested `AGENTS.md` files hold area-specific rules; the routing table at the
end lists them. `CLAUDE.md` files are symlinks to their sibling `AGENTS.md`.

## How work flows here

GitHub Issues is the public tracker, and every PR links a documented issue.
The issue carries the context reviewers and future readers need: for a bug,
the reproduction, impact, and evidence; for a change, the motivation, impact,
risk, and verification plan.

1. Find or file the issue with the bug or feature form. It does not need
   maintainer approval first; file it before or alongside the PR.
2. Work on a branch, open a PR against `main` whose body says
   `Closes #<issue>`, and let CI and review run.
3. Maintainers triage issues with `status/needs-triage`, `status/needs-info`,
   `status/needs-repro`, `status/needs-design`, and `status/accepted`
   (confirmed); see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Maintainers also keep an internal bd ledger. It is optional for contributors
and not a substitute for the GitHub issue.

## Agent contribution policy

- Every PR closes a documented issue. If none exists for your change, file
  one with the bug or feature form fields, filling each from evidence and
  answering `NOT_ENOUGH_INFO` where the evidence runs out, then link it from
  the PR.
- A human reviews and stands behind every issue and PR an agent drafts.
  Evidence that the change works end-to-end is required; "unit tests pass"
  alone is not evidence.
- Before implementing work, opening a PR, or merging/closing a PR, run the PR
  preflight:
  ```bash
  scripts/pr-preflight.sh --search "<topic keywords>" --repo gastownhall/beads
  scripts/pr-preflight.sh <pr-number> --repo gastownhall/beads
  ```
  The preflight is the agent gate for PR handling; do not rely on
  auto-discovery of CONTRIBUTING.md.
- Use `gh` for GitHub issues and PRs, not browser tools. Write PR, issue,
  comment, and review bodies to a file, run `scripts/gh-body-lint <body-file>`,
  and pass the file with `gh ... --body-file`. Sign agent-written GitHub
  comments and reviews per [engdocs/AGENT_SIGNING.md](engdocs/AGENT_SIGNING.md).

## Contributor protection

External contributor PRs have priority. Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
— it contains promises we've made to contributors — and, before triaging,
reviewing, landing, closing, or otherwise maintaining PRs,
[PR_MAINTAINER_GUIDELINES.md](PR_MAINTAINER_GUIDELINES.md). The maintainer
policy is to maximize community throughput: find useful contributor value,
absorb or transform it locally when practical, preserve attribution, and use
request-changes only as a last resort.

Before implementing any feature or fix, check for existing open PRs on the
same topic. If one exists:

1. **Review it first** — read the diff, understand the approach.
2. **Build on their work, don't rewrite it** — check out their branch,
   fix/adapt as needed.
3. **Preserve their tests** — keep them unless they're wrong.
4. **Attribute properly** — `Co-authored-by:` in commits, reference their PR.
5. **Never close or supersede their PR silently.** If a rewrite is
   unavoidable, explain why on the original PR and credit their design/tests.

## Scope: where a change belongs

Read [engdocs/PROJECT_CHARTER.md](engdocs/PROJECT_CHARTER.md) before adding
feature surface area. Beads owns issue tracking primitives and should not
encode orchestration-layer policy, become a storage engine, or casually expand
the database schema when metadata would work. Prefer, in order: issue
metadata over new fields, a flag on an existing command over a new command,
an integration or plugin over core, and leave orchestration policy to the
orchestration layer.

**Storage boundary.** Beads talks to storage through a driver interface
(`dolthub/driver` for Dolt). Do not add beads-side flocks, engine
introspection, storage-specific retry or crash-recovery logic, or public SDK
return types that leak driver internals. If the boundary is too narrow, widen
the interface or route the issue to the driver instead of patching around it
in beads. `bd doctor` support for embedded mode is enabled one subcommand at a
time, each human-vetted (GH#3794): do not lift the embedded-mode gate in
`cmd/bd/doctor.go` wholesale, and keep database-layer checks and fixes
server-gated until the driver interface covers them.

**Layering.** Schema → `internal/storage/issueops` → `cmd/bd`. Add new
primitives at the lowest layer first, one layer per PR, stacked when a fix
spans layers. See
[CONTRIBUTING_PR_GUIDELINES.md](CONTRIBUTING_PR_GUIDELINES.md).

## Build, test, lint

```bash
make install       # build and install bd to ~/.local/bin (canonical)
make test          # unit tests with the right build tags
make ci-pr-lint    # required zero-finding formatting + lint contract
make check-docs    # doc flag, freshness, and docsync checks
make bazel-sync    # after adding/removing/renaming Go files or changing imports/go.mod
```

- **Do NOT** use `go build -o bd ./cmd/bd`, `go install ./cmd/bd`, or raw
  `go run ./cmd/bd ...`: they bypass the canonical build path, leave stale
  binaries, and raw `go run` misses the `gms_pure_go` tag. Use `make install`,
  `./bd`, or `go run -tags gms_pure_go ./cmd/bd ...`.
- All new features need tests. Choose them with
  [engdocs/TESTING.md](engdocs/TESTING.md); it is the canonical source for
  commands, test design, and PR-readiness gates.
- **Never pollute a production database with test issues.** Use `t.TempDir()`
  in Go tests and a disposable working directory for manual `bd` experiments.
- `make ci-pr-lint` must pass with zero issues; see
  [engdocs/LINTING.md](engdocs/LINTING.md).
- **Optional shared Bazel cache (opt-in).** `--config=fork-cache` reads the
  project's anonymous, read-only cache, so results CI already computed are
  hits and nothing is uploaded. It is off by default; when setting up a dev
  environment, ask your human before adding `build --config=fork-cache` to
  `.bazelrc.local`.
- Without Bazel, let CI sync BUILD files: on same-repo PRs the bazel-autofix
  workflow pushes the fix to your branch (pull before pushing again); fork PRs
  get a comment with an apply recipe.
- If you changed behavior, update the user docs (`docs/`, via the
  `beads-docs` skill) or README in the same PR.

## Commits and PRs

- Conventional Commits: `type(scope): summary` (`fix`, `feat`, `docs`,
  `test`, `refactor`, `chore`, `ci`, `perf`).
- For agent-prepared commits, include the `Agent-Signature:` trailer described
  in [engdocs/AGENT_SIGNING.md](engdocs/AGENT_SIGNING.md). Use
  `unknown-model` or `unknown-reasoning` when reliable runtime metadata is
  unavailable.
- Maintainers working from the internal ledger may also end the subject with
  the bead ID, e.g. `(bd-abc)`, so `bd doctor` can detect orphaned issues.
- Work on a feature branch and open a PR against `main`; direct pushes to
  `main` are reserved for releases and narrow operational fixes.
- When the user asks to bump the version, use `./scripts/bump-version.sh`; the
  full release process is in [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md).

## Ending a session

Do not push to `main`. Before handing off:

1. Run the quality gates your change needs (`make ci-pr-lint`, the tests
   [engdocs/TESTING.md](engdocs/TESTING.md) selects). If gates are broken on
   `main`, report it as a P0 issue.
2. Record follow-up work as GitHub issues (or ledger beads, for maintainers).
3. Commit, push, or open a PR only when the person you are working for asked
   you to. Report changed files, validation run, and anything left open.

## CLI output

**NEVER use emoji-style icons** (🔴🟠🟡🔵⚪) in CLI output. **ALWAYS use small
Unicode symbols** with semantic colors: status `○ ◐ ● ✓ ❄`; priority as a
`P0`–`P4` label with color (no status glyph). The full visual design system
and CLI design principles are in
[engdocs/UI_PHILOSOPHY.md](engdocs/UI_PHILOSOPHY.md).

## Non-interactive shell commands

Agents cannot answer prompts. Use `cp -f`, `mv -f`, `rm -f`, `rm -rf`,
`cp -rf` (these may be aliased to `-i`); `scp`/`ssh -o BatchMode=yes`;
`apt-get -y`; `HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE=1 brew`. **DO NOT use `bd edit`** — it
opens `$EDITOR`; use `bd update <id> --title/--description/--design/--acceptance/--append-notes`
(pipe text with special characters via `--description=-`).
