# build-tags: allow-bare (builds a historical release from its own module
# source with its own go.mod, exactly as lib/binary.sh does; that release
# predates gms_pure_go and must not be built with today's tags)
# Builds a historical bd from its module source, offline, the way
# scripts/migration-test/lib/binary.sh's build_verified_v091_source_binary
# does with network access: `go mod download` the module, then `go build
# -trimpath ./cmd/bd` in its directory with CGO and a writable copy of its
# go.mod, using the Go release it was qualified on.
#
# Usage: build_source_tag.sh <out> <go binary> <a file under the proxy tree> <module> <version> <go version>
# Paths are execroot-relative ($(execpath ...)). GOPROXY is the pinned
# file:// tree (tools/bazel/go_module_proxy.bzl), so every module is a
# sha256-verified input, and go checks each dependency against the module's
# go.sum; GOSUMDB is off because there is no network to reach it.
