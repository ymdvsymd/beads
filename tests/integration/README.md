# Integration Tests

This directory contains integration tests for bd (beads) that test end-to-end functionality.

## Prerequisites

- bd installed: `go install github.com/steveyegge/beads/cmd/bd@latest`
- Python 3.7+ for Python-based tests

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all integration tests
python3 -m pytest tests/integration/
```

## Adding New Tests

Integration tests should:
1. Use temporary workspaces (cleaned up automatically)
2. Test real bd CLI commands, not just internal APIs
3. Use embedded mode for fast execution (no Dolt server dependency)
4. Verify behavior via `bd show --json` or `bd list --json` when relevant
5. Clean up resources in `finally` blocks
6. Provide clear output showing what's being tested
